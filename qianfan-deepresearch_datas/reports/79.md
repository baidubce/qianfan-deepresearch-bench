# Transgressing the Frame: A Critical Study of Transgender Representation in Middle Eastern and North African Cinema
## 1 Introduction: Mapping the Terrain of Trans Cinema in the MENA Region

This introductory chapter establishes the foundational framework for a critical study of transgender representation in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) cinema. The research aims to navigate the complex terrain where cinematic expression intersects with the lived realities of transgender individuals in a region marked by profound socio-legal contradictions. As evidenced by the reference materials, which span from the early documentary *Cinema Fouad* (1993) to the recent *Treat Me Like Your Mother* (2025), MENA filmmakers have been persistently engaging with trans themes, often under conditions of severe constraint[^1][^2]. The core objective of this study is to critically analyze the evolution, thematic concerns, and representational strategies of these narratives. It seeks to understand how cinema functions as a site for negotiating identity, visibility, and survival within contexts where gender non-conformity can be met with legal persecution, social ostracization, or, paradoxically, state-sanctioned medical intervention, as exemplified by Iran's unique legal framework[^3].

The analysis will be guided by an interdisciplinary approach, integrating key lenses from transgender studies—such as critiques of the medical-industrial complex, theories of embodiment, and the concept of self-determination—with established methodologies from film studies, including narrative analysis, genre theory, and the ethics of representation. This synthesis is crucial for examining films not merely as stories but as cultural artifacts that reflect and refract the pressures of their environments. The study will focus on critical issues of authorship, investigating the perspectives of filmmakers like Tanaz Eshaghian, Mohamed Soueid, and Negar Azarbayjani[^3][^1][^4]. It will dissect modes of representation, from the intimate documentary portrait to the narrative feature, and interrogate how these films navigate the intersection of gender identity with powerful discourses of nationalism, religion, family honor, and diaspora. Through close textual analysis of pivotal works such as *Be Like Others*, *Facing Mirrors*, and *Joyland*, contextualized within their specific production and reception dynamics (including festival circuits, censorship battles, and underground screenings), this research aims to challenge monolithic narratives about both the MENA region and transgender experience[^5][^2]. By situating this cinematic tradition within broader academic and cultural conversations, this chapter sets the stage for a detailed exploration of a vital, yet often marginalized, corpus of world cinema.

### 1.1 Defining the Scope: Trans Cinema in the MENA Context

This subchapter establishes the precise geographical, temporal, and conceptual parameters that bound this research. The term "MENA region" is employed here not as a monolithic entity but as a geographical and cultural designation encompassing a diverse array of nations, including but not limited to Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Egypt, as reflected in the film corpus derived from the reference materials[^3][^1][^6][^5]. The temporal scope spans from the early 1990s to the present (2025), capturing a significant period of cinematic engagement with transgender themes. This periodization is anchored by key films: the documentary *Cinema Fouad* (1993) offers an early portrait of a Syrian trans woman in Beirut, while *Treat Me Like Your Mother* (2025) presents a contemporary, celebratory archive of trans women's lives in Lebanon, demonstrating an evolution in both form and perspective over three decades[^1][^2].

**Conceptually, defining "transgender" within the MENA context requires careful attention to local specificities and the fraught relationship between identity, practice, and legal categorization.** A critical case is Iran, where a 1987 fatwa (religious decree) by Ayatollah Khomeini permitted gender reassignment surgery for "diagnosed transsexuals"[^3]. This has created a paradoxical situation where the state provides medical and financial support for transition, while same-sex relations remain illegal and punishable by death[^3]. This legal framework profoundly influences narratives, as seen in *Be Like Others*, where director Tanaz Eshaghian explores how the shame associated with homosexuality can drive individuals to seek surgery as a socially sanctioned alternative[^3]. The film presents patients who vehemently distance themselves from a gay identity, highlighting how state policy can shape and constrain self-understanding[^3]. Therefore, this study understands "trans cinema" broadly as films that centrally feature characters or real individuals who cross or transcend the gender binary assigned at birth, while remaining acutely aware of how these identities are negotiated within, and sometimes against, dominant legal and religious discourses.

The primary film corpus for analysis is drawn directly from the provided reference materials and can be categorized as follows:

| **Film Title** | **Year** | **Country/Director Origin** | **Format** | **Core Subject** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Be Like Others* (aka *Transsexual in Iran*) | 2008 | Iran/Canada (Tanaz Eshaghian) | Documentary | Young men in Iran undergoing sex-change surgery to avoid persecution as homosexuals[^3]. |
| *Cinema Fouad* / *Cinema Al Fouad* | 1993 | Lebanon (Mohamed Soueid) | Documentary | Portrait of Khaled El Kurdi, a Syrian trans woman working in Beirut[^1]. |
| *Facing Mirrors* (*Aynehaye rooberoo*) | 2011 | Iran (Negar Azarbayjani) | Narrative Feature | A transgender man (Eddie) and a conservative female taxi driver form an unlikely friendship[^4][^5]. |
| *Joyland* | 2022 | Pakistan (Saim Sadiq) | Narrative Feature | A man becomes infatuated with a transgender dancer (Biba), disrupting his traditional family[^5]. |
| *The Blue Caftan* | 2022 | Morocco (Maryam Touzani) | Narrative Feature | A master tailor grapples with his desire for a male apprentice, within his marriage[^5][^7]. |
| *Run(a)way Arab* | 2017/2018 | UK (Amrou Al-Kadhi) | Short Film/Drama | A Middle Eastern drag queen reflects on early gender transgressions and his relationship with his mother[^7][^8]. |
| *The Great Safae* | 2014 | Morocco/France (Randa Maroufi) | Short Film/Docufiction | Re-imagines the daily life of a transgender domestic worker based on a real person[^8]. |
| *Kelet* | 2020 | Finland (Susani Mahadura) | Documentary | A young Somali trans woman builds a new life and pursues her dream of becoming a Vogue model[^9]. |
| *Treat Me Like Your Mother* | 2025 | Lebanon (Mohamad Abdouni) | Documentary | Intimate narratives of four trans women in Lebanon, creating a history of trans resilience[^2]. |

This corpus guides the study's focus on the interplay between representation (how trans lives are depicted), authorship (who tells these stories and from what position), and the complex intersection of gender identity with regional discourses of family, religion, law, and diaspora. The scope is deliberately bounded to allow for deep analysis while acknowledging the vast diversity within the MENA region and its global diasporas.

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework and Methodological Approach

This subchapter delineates the interdisciplinary analytical toolkit that will be employed to dissect the selected films. The research is grounded in the synthesis of two primary fields: transgender studies and film studies. From transgender studies, the analysis draws upon foundational critiques of the **medical-industrial complex**, which scrutinizes how medical institutions often act as gatekeepers to gender-affirming care, a dynamic starkly visible in the clinical setting of *Be Like Others*[^3]. Theories of **embodiment** and **performativity** (extending Judith Butler's work) are crucial for understanding how gender is negotiated, displayed, and felt in cinematic narratives, such as in the meticulous tailoring scenes in *The Blue Caftan* or the drag performance preparation in *Run(a)way Arab*[^7][^8]. Furthermore, the **"trans of color critique"** provides an essential lens to examine how trans identities intersect with race, colonialism, and migration, particularly in diasporic films like *Kelet*, which follows a Somali trans woman in Finland[^9].

From film studies, the methodology incorporates **narrative analysis** to deplot how stories about trans lives are structured—whether as journeys of self-discovery, tales of familial conflict, or chronicles of social oppression. **Formal analysis** of mise-en-scène, cinematography, and editing will be used to interpret how visual and aural elements construct meaning, such as the use of domestic spaces in *Cinema Fouad* to contrast safety with external aggression[^1]. **Genre theory** helps situate films within conventions (e.g., documentary, drama, melodrama) and understand how they adhere to or subvert expectations. Crucially, the study engages with **theories of representation and the gaze**, questioning who has the authority to look and represent, and what ethical responsibilities arise when depicting marginalized subjects, a central concern in documentaries like *Be Like Others* and *Treat Me Like Your Mother*[^3][^2].

The methodological approach is resolutely data-driven, using the specific narratives, formal choices, and production contexts detailed in the reference materials as the primary evidence for all arguments. This involves close textual analysis of selected films, where scenes, dialogue, and visual motifs are examined in detail. For instance, the analysis of *Facing Mirrors* will scrutinize the evolving dynamics in the confined space of the taxi, using the film's own narrative of cross-class encounter as a microcosm for broader social negotiations[^4][^5]. **Contextual analysis** is equally vital, examining how films navigate real-world constraints. This includes studying instances of censorship (e.g., the initial ban and subsequent edited release of *Joyland* in Pakistan)[^5], the significance of festival circuits (like the Teddy Award at Berlinale for *Crossing* or the Queer Palm at Cannes for *Joyland*)[^5][^10], and the implications of production models (such as the queer-led ArabQ Films)[^2]. The methodology also considers **reception**, acknowledging how films are positioned and interpreted within different cultural spheres, from international film festivals to clandestine screenings in countries where LGBTQ+ content is prohibited[^2].

### 1.3 Core Research Questions and Significance of the Study

This subchapter articulates the central inquiries that propel the research and substantiates its academic, cultural, and political significance. The research questions emerge directly from the tensions, patterns, and silences observed within the corpus of reference materials:

1.  **How do MENA trans films strategically negotiate the dual imperatives of visibility and safety within repressive or paradoxical legal regimes?** This question probes the tactical choices filmmakers and subjects make. For example, how does *Be Like Others* expose the clinical process of gender transition in Iran while highlighting how this very system can coerce individuals seeking social legitimacy?[^3] How do films like *The Wedding* by ArabQ Films organize secret, speakeasy-style screenings with strict safety protocols to reach audiences in countries where public exhibition is impossible?[^2]

2.  **What distinct representational strategies and ethical considerations differentiate documentary from narrative fiction in depicting MENA transgender experiences?** This question compares modes of storytelling. It examines the intimate, observational approach of *Cinema Fouad*, which builds a portrait through domestic rituals[^1], against the crafted narrative arc of *Facing Mirrors*, which uses a road trip to forge empathy across social divides[^4]. It also interrogates the power dynamics inherent in documentary, asking how films like *Treat Me Like Your Mother* attempt to create a collaborative, celebratory archive rather than a trauma-centric exposé[^2][^10].

3.  **How do these films interrogate the intersection of transgender identity with foundational discourses of family honor, religious doctrine, national belonging, and diasporic memory?** This question explores the multifaceted conflicts at the heart of many narratives. It investigates the pressure to produce a male heir in *Joyland*, which catalyzes the family crisis[^5]. It analyzes the internalized guilt experienced by Halim in *The Blue Caftan*, set against Morocco's laws criminalizing homosexuality[^5][^7]. It also considers how diasporic films like *Kelet* and *Run(a)way Arab* navigate the complexities of belonging, bridging ancestral cultures with new communities and queer subcultures[^8][^9].

**The significance of this study is multifold.** Firstly, it contributes to **decolonizing film and gender studies** by centering cinematic voices and narratives from the MENA region and its diasporas, challenging the Western-centric frameworks that often dominate queer and trans cinema scholarship. By analyzing films like *Facing Mirrors*—hailed as the first Iranian narrative film with a transgender protagonist—the research documents and critically engages with an evolving cinematic tradition that operates under its own unique constraints and innovations[^5].

Secondly, the study highlights the **role of cinema as a vital site of cultural negotiation and community formation**. Films such as *Treat Me Like Your Mother* are not merely representations but active projects of historical preservation and community building, creating a "photographic scrapbook" of trans resilience in Lebanon[^2]. Similarly, the launch of production companies like ArabQ Films represents an institutional effort to create a sustainable platform for queer narratives from within the region[^2].

Finally, this research has **broader social and political relevance**. By examining how filmmakers navigate censorship, social stigma, and contested notions of morality, the study sheds light on the ongoing struggles for recognition and rights faced by transgender communities in the MENA region. It demonstrates how cinematic narratives can serve as powerful tools for fostering empathy, challenging stereotypes, and imagining different futures, even when circulated through alternative or underground channels. In doing so, this paper aims to amplify these often-overlooked stories and contribute to a more nuanced, global understanding of transgender lives and artistic expression.

## 2 Theoretical Frameworks: Intersecting Trans Theory and Film Analysis

This chapter constructs a bespoke analytical framework by critically synthesizing key concepts from transgender studies and film theory, specifically tailored to interrogate the MENA trans cinema corpus. The films under examination—from the clinical exposé of *Be Like Others* to the intimate portraiture of *Treat Me Like Your Mother*—operate within a complex matrix of socio-legal constraints, cultural taboos, and diasporic negotiations. To unpack these narratives, a singular theoretical lens is insufficient. Instead, this analysis requires an interdisciplinary dialogue that can account for both the formal properties of cinematic storytelling and the specific political and embodied realities of transgender existence in the region. This chapter first establishes the foundational tenets of each field, drawing directly on the provided reference materials. It then focuses on the productive tensions and synergies at this intersection, demonstrating how a combined framework can reveal the intricate ways MENA films negotiate identity, visibility, and power. This integrated lens is pivotal, providing the methodological backbone for the detailed film analyses that follow, moving beyond generic application to develop a context-sensitive mode of critical reading.

### 2.1 Core Tenets of Transgender Studies for Cinematic Analysis

This subchapter distills and operationalizes key concepts from transgender studies as essential analytical tools for film. These frameworks allow us to move beyond surface-level representation to interrogate how cinema constructs, mediates, and challenges understandings of gender identity.

**Gender Performativity and the "Transgender Gaze"**
Judith Butler’s theory of gender performativity, which posits that gender is constituted through the stylized repetition of acts rather than expressing a pre-existing inner essence, is a cornerstone for analyzing on-screen gender transgression[^11][^12]. This is particularly relevant for films featuring acts of passing, impersonation, or drag. However, a crucial development for cinematic analysis is Jack Halberstam’s concept of the **"transgender gaze."** Halberstam argues this gaze is characterized by its ability to destabilize cisgender norms by altering the logic of "lack" and by affirming queer existence as a "way of life"[^13]. This theoretical move shifts analysis from what is represented to *how* the act of looking is structured. For instance, a film that adopts the point-of-view of a transgender character, forcing the audience to provisionally see the world through their eyes, enacts a form of transgender gaze that can challenge normative identification processes[^14][^15]. This concept will be vital for analyzing films like *Facing Mirrors*, where the confined space of a taxi becomes a site for shared, transformative looking between characters of vastly different social positions.

**Embodiment, Dysphoria, and the Aesthetics of Change**
Transgender studies foregrounds the lived experience of the body, including the profound disconnection of gender dysphoria and the transformative process of transition. Eliza Steinbock’s concept of the **"shimmering image"** offers a powerful cinematic-philosophical tool to analyze this. Steinbock traces how film can present sex and gender as "mirage-like," delineating change in its emergent form and capturing the qualities of transforming bodies, images, and affects[^16]. This framework moves beyond a binary before/after narrative to focus on the processual and affective dimensions of transition. It provides a language to analyze the visual strategies—lighting, editing, cinematography—that films use to mediate bodily change, whether in the clinical setting of *Be Like Others* or the more personal, celebratory archive of *Treat Me Like Your Mother*.

**Critique of the Medical-Industrial Complex**
A critical strand of transgender scholarship examines the **"medical-industrial complex,"** a system where access to gender-affirming care is controlled by medical and psychiatric institutions, often creating pathologizing gatekeeping mechanisms and significant economic incentives[^12]. This critique is directly applicable to the MENA context, especially Iran. The state’s unique legal framework, originating from a fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini, provides financial and surgical support for transition while criminalizing homosexuality[^17][^13]. This creates a coercive dynamic where surgery can be pursued as a socially sanctioned alternative to a persecuted gay identity, a central theme explored in *Be Like Others*. Analyzing such films through this lens reveals not just personal stories but the operation of state power and medical authority in shaping transgender subjectivities.

**Intersectionality and the Trans of Color Critique**
Finally, any analysis of MENA trans cinema must be grounded in **intersectionality** and the **"trans of color critique."** This perspective insists that transgender identity cannot be understood in isolation but is always shaped by concurrent systems of power based on race, ethnicity, class, migration status, and disability[^18][^12]. For the MENA region and its diasporas, this means grappling with the legacies of colonialism, Orientalist fantasies, Islamophobia, and racialization. A study interviewing transgender and gender-diverse individuals noted that media representations often enforce a narrow "transnormativity" that is white, upper-class, and excludes people of color[^18]. Furthermore, media has a history of dehumanizing Black transgender individuals, with roots in racism[^12]. This framework is essential for analyzing diasporic films like *Kelet* (following a Somali trans woman in Finland) and *Run(a)way Arab*, ensuring our readings address the specific racialized, colonial, and migratory dimensions of these narratives.

### 2.2 Foundational Concepts in Film Theory and the Politics of Representation

This subchapter outlines essential film theory concepts, focusing on their utility and limitations for analyzing transgender narratives. These tools allow us to dissect how meaning is produced through cinematic form, narrative structure, and the ethical relations of production.

**The Gaze and Spectatorial Pleasure**
Laura Mulvey’s seminal concept of the **"male gaze"** explains how classic Hollywood cinema is structured around a heterosexual male viewpoint, objectifying female characters for both the male protagonist’s and the audience’s voyeuristic pleasure[^14][^19]. This creates a fundamental challenge for representing transgender bodies, which often present an "ambiguity" that hinders the viewer’s ability to experience straightforward visual pleasure or identification within a binary gender framework[^14][^15]. The question then becomes: how do films with transgender characters compensate for or subvert this challenge? John Phillips suggests they often rely on plots of **"deception and revelation,"** where the audience derives pleasure from either observing a transgender character’s "passing" or from the shock of a later "big reveal"[^14][^15]. This trope, however, risks reinforcing the idea that transgender identity is inherently deceptive. Analyzing MENA films requires examining how they engage with, resist, or rework these gaze dynamics and narrative compensations.

**Narrative Tropes: The "Progress Narrative" and Beyond**
A key narrative template identified by Marjorie Garber is the **"progress narrative."** In cross-dressing comedies like *Some Like It Hot*, characters are compelled by social or economic forces to disguise themselves temporarily to gain freedom or escape repression[^14][^15]. The narrative implicitly condones cross-dressing only as a functional, liminal, and temporary act, ultimately reaffirming a "natural" order of fixed gender[^14]. This trope is a baseline against which more complex transgender stories can be measured. For example, *Boys Don’t Cry* is noted for deviating from this narrative; for its protagonist Brandon, "passing is not... a means to an end, as in the comedies, but the end itself"[^14]. Identifying whether MENA films employ, critique, or ignore the progress narrative will be crucial for understanding their ideological stance on gender fluidity.

**Genre, Authorship, and Documentary Ethics**
The distinction between narrative fiction and documentary carries significant ethical weight. Documentaries like *Be Like Others* or *Treat Me Like Your Mother* claim a privileged relationship to "truth" and real lives, which raises urgent questions about **extraction, compensation, and authorship**. The reference materials highlight a long-standing, contentious practice in documentary filmmaking of not compensating subjects, as criticized in the case of *Paris Is Burning*, which documented low-income ballroom culture participants[^20][^21]. In contrast, the making of *Disclosure* is presented as a model of ethical practice: it compensated its creative consultants, prioritized hiring transgender crew and researchers, and aimed to center the community it documented both in front of and behind the camera[^20]. This ethical framework is directly applicable to assessing films in our corpus, asking who tells the story, who benefits, and how the power dynamics between filmmaker and subject are navigated.

**The Persistence of Harmful Tropes**
Film theory also provides a vocabulary for identifying persistent and damaging stereotypes. The **"trans killer"** trope, born in *Psycho* and amplified by *The Silence of the Lambs*, links transgender identity with psychosis, violence, and murder, communicating that "gender dysphoria... might even lead to psychosis and murder"[^14][^15]. Another common pattern is the **"tragic" transgender character**, often desexualized or doomed to unrequited love, which ultimately reinforces heteronormativity even in ostensibly sympathetic films[^14][^15]. Recognizing these tropes allows us to critically evaluate whether MENA films replicate Hollywood’s harmful patterns or forge new, more nuanced representational paths.

### 2.3 Synthesis and Application: Building an Interdisciplinary Lens for MENA Trans Cinema

This subchapter is the core of the theoretical integration, demonstrating how the combined frameworks generate unique, context-sensitive insights into the MENA film corpus. The synthesis navigates tensions and leverages synergies to build a robust analytical lens.

**Navigating Tensions: Western Theory and Cultural Specificity**
A primary tension involves applying Western-derived theories (Butler, Mulvey, Halberstam) to non-Western cinematic contexts. Scholars like Joseph Massad argue that identities like "gay" or "lesbian" are Western imports and that Arab cultures have tolerated same-sex relations only as long as they remain unnamed[^22]. This critique warns against a simplistic, universalizing application of identity-based frameworks. Furthermore, an analysis of Chinese transgender performance in film argues that Western gender theory may not be universally applicable, emphasizing the need for contextualized analysis that considers local histories, ideologies, and social structures[^11]. Therefore, our interdisciplinary lens must use these theories not as rigid templates but as flexible tools, constantly checked against the specific socio-cultural logics present in the films themselves. For instance, the performativity of gender in a Moroccan film like *The Blue Caftan* may intersect with local crafts, spirituality, and legal codes in ways that challenge a purely Butlerian reading.

**Synergistic Applications: Decoding the MENA Trans Film**
The true power of the interdisciplinary approach lies in these synergistic applications, using combined frameworks to decode specific films:

*   **The Clinical Gaze Meets the Medical-Industrial Complex:** Analyzing *Be Like Others* requires merging formal film analysis with the critique of the medical-industrial complex. The camera’s observational, sometimes detached, perspective in the clinic can be read as a **"clinical gaze,"** objectifying the patients as medical cases. When viewed through the lens of Iran’s paradoxical laws[^17][^12], this cinematic gaze exposes the system’s coercive nature. The film’s narrative structure—following individuals through diagnosis, approval, and surgery—mirrors the institutional pathway, making the audience complicit in witnessing how state-sanctioned medicine shapes and legitimizes certain identities while erasing others.

*   **Challenging the "Progress Narrative" and Orientalist Expectations:** *Facing Mirrors*, the story of a transgender man and a conservative female taxi driver in Iran, can be productively analyzed by combining narrative theory with postcolonial critique. The film avoids the classic "deception/revelation" plot and the temporary "progress narrative." Instead, its road trip structure fosters a slow-building, cross-class intimacy. This narrative choice resists both cisnormative storytelling tropes *and* Western Orientalist expectations of Iranian cinema as solely depicting oppressed, tragic queer subjects[^17][^13]. The film’s focus on complex characters with agency and its success within Iran’s own cultural spaces (like the Fajr festival) challenges the Western gaze that often consumes Middle Eastern queer stories as exotic fantasies[^17].

*   **Embodiment, Ethics, and the Celebratory Archive:** The recent documentary *Treat Me Like Your Mother* exemplifies how theories of embodiment and documentary ethics can jointly illuminate a film’s significance. The film’s intimate, collaborative portraiture of trans women in Lebanon aligns with ethical production models that compensate and center subjects[^20]. Its aesthetic, creating a "photographic scrapbook," can be interpreted through Steinbock’s concept of the **"shimmering image,"** capturing the resilience, beauty, and processual nature of its subjects’ lives rather than framing them through trauma or medical transition[^16]. This approach represents a conscious move away from extractive, trauma-centric documentary practices toward a community-based archive of joy and survival.

*   **Intersectional Analysis of Diasporic Narratives:** Films like *Kelet* (Somali trans woman in Finland) and *Run(a)way Arab* (Arab drag queen in the UK) demand the integrated lens of the trans of color critique, diaspora studies, and formal analysis. These films navigate the intersection of transgender identity with race, migration, memory, and often Islamophobia. Analyzing them requires looking at how their visual and narrative strategies—perhaps using flashbacks, drag performance, or scenes of cultural negotiation—express the complexity of hybrid identities that exist at the crossroads of multiple communities and marginalizations[^18][^12].

By weaving together these theoretical strands, this chapter establishes a sophisticated, adaptable framework. It equips the subsequent analysis to move beyond describing what is in these films to critically interpreting *how* they work—aesthetically, narratively, and politically—within the fraught and fertile terrain of MENA transgender cinema.

## 3 Contexts and Constraints: Trans Lives at the Crossroads of Culture, Law, and Religion

This chapter provides a granular, data-driven analysis of the complex socio-political, legal, and religious landscapes that fundamentally shape the lived realities of transgender individuals and the conditions for cinematic production across the MENA region. It moves beyond the introductory overview to conduct a comparative examination of specific national contexts, synthesizing information from the reference materials to delineate the distinct pressures filmmakers face. The analysis will focus on three interconnected domains: 1) the legal frameworks governing gender identity, sexuality, and expression, contrasting Iran's paradoxical state-sanctioned surgery model with the criminalization and legal vacuums in countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco; 2) the pervasive social stigma, discrimination, and violence documented in reports, which create the hostile environments these films depict and must navigate; and 3) the specific mechanisms of censorship and control—both state-led and through digital platforms—that directly impact film production, distribution, and exhibition. By structurally absorbing key data points from the reference materials on laws, enforcement, digital targeting, and funding challenges, this chapter establishes the concrete constraints and urgent stakes that inform the representational strategies and thematic concerns of the cinematic corpus analyzed in subsequent chapters.

### 3.1 Legal Landscapes: From State-Sanctioned Surgery to Criminalization

The legal terrain for transgender individuals in the MENA region is characterized by profound contradictions, ranging from a unique form of state-sanctioned medical transition to outright criminalization and legal voids. A comparative analysis reveals how these divergent legal frameworks directly inform the narratives and ethical dilemmas explored in MENA trans cinema.

**Iran's Paradoxical Model: Sanctioned Surgery and Coercive Filtering**
Iran presents a globally unique case where sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is officially recognized and financially supported by the state, a policy originating from a 1987 fatwa by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini[^23][^24]. This recognition allows transgender individuals who undergo state-approved SRS to change their legal gender markers, access inheritance rights aligned with their new gender, and, critically, avoid prosecution for homosexuality, which is punishable by death[^23][^24]. However, this system functions as a coercive **medical-industrial complex**. The process for legal recognition is arduous, restricted to adults, and requires formal parental approval[^23]. Applicants must undergo a lengthy "filtering" process by the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization, involving at least six months of therapy, family interviews, physical examinations, and hormone and chromosomal tests designed explicitly to separate those deemed "transgender" from those deemed "homosexual"[^23]. The state classifies transgender identity as "Gender Identity Disorder" (GID), an outdated and pathologizing term[^23][^24]. This legal-medical apparatus creates the central tension explored in films like *Be Like Others*, where individuals may pursue surgery not solely from self-determined gender affirmation but as a socially sanctioned alternative to a persecuted gay identity[^23]. The quality of state-provided healthcare is often dangerously low, leading to permanent complications, and there are no laws protecting transgender people from discrimination or hate crimes[^23].

**Legal Vacuums and Conflation with Criminalized Acts**
In stark contrast to Iran, countries like Egypt, Lebanon, and Tunisia lack clear legislative avenues for legal gender recognition, creating a precarious legal vacuum[^23]. Judicial authorities review applications on a case-by-case basis, leading to a protracted (three to ten years), expensive, and inaccessible process[^23]. Courts often require applicants to have completed all surgical and hormonal interventions—a significant barrier given the lack of accessible gender-affirming healthcare in these countries[^23]. **This judicial discretion frequently relies on interpretations of Islamic Shari'a, which distinguishes between permissible "gender correction" surgery for intersex people and prohibited "sex change" procedures for transgender individuals**[^23][^25]. For instance, a 2016 Egyptian administrative court rejected a transgender man's request, stating such surgery for "gender identity disorder" violated Shari'a principles and traditional social values[^23].

Furthermore, while no law in these three countries explicitly criminalizes being transgender, security forces routinely conflate gender identity with sexual orientation[^23][^26]. Transgender people are frequently arrested under broadly defined laws against "public indecency," "habitual debauchery," or "unnatural acts"[^23][^27]. In Egypt, laws originally designed to combat prostitution are used to prosecute LGBTQ+ individuals, with courts interpreting "habitual debauchery" as synonymous with homosexuality[^23][^27]. The discrepancy between a person's gender expression and their official documents makes them highly vulnerable to police harassment, arbitrary arrest, and in detention, forced anal examinations and placement in cells not corresponding to their gender identity[^23][^26].

**Explicit Criminalization and Regressive Proposals**
Other MENA states enforce even more draconian measures. Saudi Arabia criminalizes same-sex sexual activity and gender expression under its uncodified Sharia law, with maximum penalties including death[^28]. Publicly advocating for LGBT rights is illegal, and there is evidence of enforcement, including arrests for wearing clothing of another gender and executions for same-sex activity[^28]. Kuwait's Article 198 criminalizes "imitating the opposite sex" in public with penalties of up to one year in prison[^29]. Morocco's Penal Code Article 489 prohibits "lewd or unnatural acts," used to prosecute same-sex relations and, by extension, gender-nonconforming individuals[^30].

**Emerging Nuances: Precedents and Backlash**
Amidst this repressive landscape, fragile legal precedents and intense backlash coexist. In 2016, a Lebanese appeals court allowed a transgender man to change his documents without requiring surgery, a significant but underutilized precedent due to procedural obstacles[^23][^25]. In 2019, a Tunisian court defended the right to establish an association advocating for the rights of sexual minorities, invoking international principles[^25]. Conversely, Turkey has proposed regressive amendments to raise the minimum age for legal gender recognition to 25, reintroduce compulsory sterilization, and criminalize "illegal gender change" procedures for both providers and recipients, directly contradicting rulings from its own constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights[^31][^30].

**This patchwork of legal regimes—from Iran's pathologizing sanction to Egypt's prosecutorial conflation, Saudi Arabia's capital punishment, and Turkey's proposed criminalization—forms the foundational reality that MENA trans cinema must engage. The films do not merely tell personal stories; they are cultural responses to these specific architectures of state power and legal precarity.**

### 3.2 Social Stigma, Violence, and the Realities of 'Minority Stress'

Beyond the letter of the law, a pervasive climate of social stigma, systemic discrimination, and violence constitutes the daily reality of "minority stress" for transgender individuals in the MENA region. Cinematic narratives are deeply embedded in this hostile social fabric, which they both document and contest.

**Pervasive Societal Rejection and Cultural Stigma**
Social acceptance is exceedingly rare. Surveys indicate that **95% of Egyptians believe society should not accept homosexuality**, reflecting a cultural norm that extends to gender non-conformity[^23]. The very terminology is charged; Arabic media often uses the term "*shaadh*," meaning "queer," "pervert," or "deviant," while identities like "gay" or "lesbian" are seen as Western imports[^32]. This stigma is compounded for transgender women, who face dual marginalization for being women in male-led societies and for being queer[^32]. A survey of 102 transgender individuals across 14 MENA countries found that 77% originated from conservative family environments, highlighting the intimate locus of potential conflict[^33]. This societal rejection translates into systemic discrimination in employment, housing, and healthcare, pushing many into financial precarity[^29][^33].

**A Vicious Cycle of Violence and Fatal Consequences**
The reference materials document a harrowing cycle of violence against transgender people, providing the grim backdrop against which stories of resilience are set.

**Socio-Economic and Health Vulnerabilities**
This violence and discrimination manifest in acute socio-economic and health disparities. Studies show that **81% of trans women in the region report financial hardship**, 75% lack insurance coverage, and 40% have a monthly income below $500[^29]. Discrimination in medical settings is endemic, leading to avoidance of care[^29]. Mental health suffers profoundly: **43.8% of Lebanese and 63% of Syrian transgender participants in studies suffered from depression**, with exposure to discrimination and assault strongly linked to anxiety and depression[^29]. A 2021 study in Iran found that 92% of trans women had faced verbal or emotional violence and over 70% physical violence[^23].

**The films analyzed in this study do not invent their dramatic conflicts; they refract these documented realities.** The familial tensions in *Facing Mirrors* and *Joyland*, the social ostracization in *Cinema Fouad*, and the constant negotiation for safety in *Treat Me Like Your Mother* are artistic engagements with a world where legal precarity and social hostility are a constant threat. This context makes the act of cinematic representation itself a risky form of visibility.

### 3.3 Censorship, Production Hurdles, and Digital Entrapment

The production and circulation of MENA trans cinema occur within a tightly controlled ecosystem of censorship, scarce funding, and the novel threat of digital surveillance. Filmmakers must navigate these overlapping constraints, which shape everything from narrative content to how audiences can safely view their work.

**State Censorship: From Pre-Production Control to Pan-Arab Filtering**
State censorship mechanisms directly suppress queer and trans narratives. In Iran, the Culture Ministry and the Film Production Permit Committee exert strict control over all stages of filmmaking, from script development to publicity[^34]. This has spurred a wave of defiant, "illegal" independent filmmaking, where directors bypass permits, shoot in secrecy, and challenge taboos like the compulsory hijab, knowing they face potential imprisonment, fines, or exile[^27]. Internationally acclaimed filmmakers like Mohammad Rassoulof have been forced to flee the country[^27].

For commercial cinema, a sophisticated **pan-Arab censorship system** operates. Major distribution companies in hubs like Beirut pre-emptively edit films—removing scenes involving homosexuality, nudity, or religious offense—to create a "one-size-fits-all" version for multiple Arab markets[^25]. This system "enables" screening by pre-censoring content, but often distorts narratives. Films like *Bohemian Rhapsody* (2018) had same-sex kissing scenes cut for release in most Arab countries[^25]. Disney+ Middle East aligns with these standards, refusing to stream films like *Lightyear* and series like *Baymax* due to LGBTQ+ content[^25]. Gulf states like Kuwait have emerged as particularly strict, banning films like *Barbie* (2023) and *Wicked* (2024) reportedly over LGBTQ+ themes or cast members[^27].

**Funding Challenges: Western Reliance and Institutional Hesitancy**
Financing such films is a major hurdle. **A large portion of funding for Middle Eastern LGBTQ+ films comes from Western institutions or production companies**[^35]. Middle Eastern institutional funders often pass on projects perceived as "too queer," creating a reliance on European cultural funds, private donations, and crowdfunding from the LGBTQ+ community[^35]. Organizations like the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture (AFAC) provide crucial grants for documentary development, production, and post-production[^35], while initiatives like the Ford Foundation's JustFilms program fund global documentaries addressing social issues, including transgender rights[^36][^37]. Festival-led funds, such as Inside Out's RE:Focus Fund for women, non-binary, and trans filmmakers, also provide vital post-production support[^27]. This funding landscape means that many films addressing MENA trans experiences are necessarily co-productions or diaspora projects, influencing their perspective and circulation.

**Digital Targeting and Entrapment: The Online-Offline Threat**
A particularly severe constraint is **digital targeting**. Human Rights Watch reports document how security forces in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia use social media (Facebook, Instagram) and dating apps (Grindr) to entrap, harass, extort, and dox LGBT individuals[^26][^27]. They create fake profiles, initiate conversations, and then use digitally obtained "evidence" for arrests and prosecutions under cybercrime or morality laws[^26]. This practice has dire offline consequences: arbitrary detention, torture, sexual assault in custody, job loss, family violence, and forced displacement[^26][^27]. **This climate of digital surveillance creates profound risks not only for film subjects but also for audiences seeking such content online, impacting distribution strategies.**

**Counter-Strategies: Festivals, Secret Screenings, and Online Circulation**
In response, filmmakers and curators develop alternative networks for exhibition. International film festivals like the MENA Film Festival in Vancouver and Toronto provide crucial platforms, programming from a "social justice standpoint" to ensure equitable representation for queer communities[^30]. Within the region, secret, speakeasy-style screenings with strict safety protocols are organized to bypass official bans[^32]. The rise of online streaming platforms and dedicated events, like the Aflamuna platform's "Love and Identity in Arab Cinema" event, offers avenues to reach audiences without theatrical release[^32][^35]. However, these methods often reach only those actively seeking the content, operating in a precarious space between visibility and safety.

**In summary, MENA trans cinema is produced under a triple burden: state censorship that suppresses narratives, a funding environment that often externalizes support, and a digital landscape where visibility can lead to entrapment. The films that emerge are thus acts of aesthetic and political negotiation, their forms and themes indelibly marked by the struggle to be created and seen at all.**

## 4 Close Analysis I: Documentary and the Politics of Visibility

This chapter conducts a comparative, in-depth analysis of two foundational documentary films, Tanaz Eshaghian's *Be Like Others* (2008) and Mohamed Soueid's *Cinema Fouad* (1993), to critically examine how the non-fiction form constructs, mediates, and contests narratives of transgender experience within the MENA region. The analysis focuses on the distinct representational strategies and ethical dilemmas inherent to documentary filmmaking, specifically interrogating the dynamics of the ethnographic and clinical gaze, the negotiation of authorial voice and subject agency, and the framing of medical transition and social survival. By structurally absorbing detailed information from the reference materials on the films' production, narrative focus, and critical reception, this chapter dissects how these documentaries navigate the tension between exposing systemic coercion and honoring individual resilience, thereby illuminating the complex politics of visibility, authenticity, and power in representing MENA trans lives.

### 4.1 Framing the Subject: Ethnographic Gaze, Intimacy, and the Negotiation of Power

The foundational representational strategies of *Be Like Others* and *Cinema Fouad* diverge sharply, establishing distinct power dynamics between filmmaker and subject. Tanaz Eshaghian’s *Be Like Others* is structured around a **clinical gaze** that mirrors the state-sanctioned medical apparatus it documents. The film is anchored at the Mirdamad Surgical Center in Tehran, run by Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali, where patients undergo a mandatory six-month process of medical and psychological evaluation to be approved for sex reassignment surgery (SRS)[^38]. The camera often adopts an observational, sometimes detached perspective within the clinic’s waiting rooms and consultation spaces, framing the subjects as medical cases within an institutional setting[^39]. This visual strategy directly reflects the **medical-industrial complex** critique, where the state uses medical authority to filter and legitimize certain identities while erasing others[^38]. The gaze objectifies the process, forcing the viewer to witness the bureaucratic and physical mechanics of transition as a condition for social existence in Iran, where homosexuality is punishable by death but state-approved SRS is legal and partially subsidized[^39].

In stark contrast, Mohamed Soueid’s *Cinema Fouad* constructs an **intimate, domestic portraiture**. The film is a documentary portrait of Khaled El Kurdi, a Syrian trans woman living in Beirut, who works as a domestic worker and belly dancer[^1][^40]. Soueid’s camera enters El Kurdi’s private space, capturing scenes of her eating, applying makeup, and dancing in her bedroom[^1]. This framing creates a visual sanctuary of relative safety and self-expression, which is juxtaposed with El Kurdi’s own testimony about the aggression she faces outside in the street[^1]. However, this intimacy is complicated by the power dynamics of the interview itself. The reference materials note that through El Kurdi’s “defiance in the face of some of Soueid’s more goading questions, the film recognizes the echoing of these aggressions in his role as interviewer”[^1]. Thus, the film self-consciously critiques the potential for the documentary encounter itself to replicate the very social hostility it seeks to document.

The filmmakers’ own positions further inflect these dynamics. Eshaghian, an Iranian-American returning after 25 years, occupies a dual position of insider cultural understanding and outsider privilege[^39]. Her access to the clinic and subjects was facilitated by a British journalist’s contacts, and she spent time in waiting rooms to find participants[^39]. This method, while enabling the film, also positions her as an intermediary observing a system from within its institutional spaces. Soueid, as a Lebanese filmmaker, engages with a subject within a shared regional context but from different national and social positions. The comparative analysis reveals that while *Be Like Others* uses a broad, systemic gaze to expose institutional coercion, *Cinema Fouad* employs an intimate, contested gaze to explore individual interiority and the fraught nature of representation itself.

### 4.2 The Documentary as Testimony: Agency, Authenticity, and the Authorial Voice

The ethical core of both documentaries lies in the negotiation between the filmmaker’s authorial control and the subjects’ attempts to assert agency and self-narration. In *Be Like Others*, this tension is central to the film’s critical project. Eshaghian’s directorial voice is evident in her structuring of contrasting narratives—most notably between Ali (later Negar) and Anoosh (later Anahita)[^39]. Ali, facing familial rejection and his father’s death threats, undergoes surgery out of social necessity rather than unambiguous desire, ultimately ending up estranged, depressed, and engaged in sex work[^39][^17]. Anoosh, supported by his mother and boyfriend, pursues transition with apparent optimism, becoming engaged by the film’s end, though his boyfriend grows distant post-surgery[^39]. **This juxtaposition is a deliberate authorial choice to highlight the spectrum of outcomes and the critical role of family support in Iranian society**[^39]. The subjects use their testimony to navigate profound social pressures. Throughout the film, patients and post-operative individuals like Vida vehemently assert they are not homosexual, distancing themselves from a stigmatized identity to claim legitimacy within the state’s narrow framework[^39]. Eshaghian interprets this as a driven by shame, a survival mechanism to “live free from harassment”[^39].

However, the film also turns a critical lens on the agency of its subjects, particularly Vida, who acts as a counselor at the clinic. The analysis notes that “as the film goes on [Vida] appears more and more like a government mouthpiece,” insisting on the official line that homosexuality is a disorder to be corrected[^12]. This creates a layered critique: the documentary allows subjects to speak, yet simultaneously questions the degree to which their speech is shaped by, and reproduces, coercive state ideology. Eshaghian’s methodological approach also reveals ethical complexities. She found that female-to-male transsexuals, often successful in living their new gender, were reluctant to participate for fear of being “outed,” which skewed the film’s focus toward male-to-female narratives[^39]. This highlights the inherent power imbalance in documentary: the filmmaker’s quest for a story can conflict with subjects’ needs for safety and privacy.

*Cinema Fouad* presents a more concentrated struggle over narrative authority. The film’s power derives from Khaled El Kurdi’s reflective monologues and her defiant posture in response to Soueid’s probing questions[^1]. Her agency is performed through her control over her self-presentation in the domestic sphere and through her articulation of her desires—including her wish for gender reassignment surgery and her mourning for a deceased Palestinian lover[^40]. However, the reference materials suggest the filmmaker’s presence is not neutral; the “goading questions” potentially position the interview as a re-enactment of external judgment[^1]. The ethical model here is not one of collaborative celebration but of **tense negotiation**, where the subject’s authenticity is asserted in direct response to an interrogative gaze. This differs from Eshaghian’s broader sociological approach, focusing instead on the psychological immediacy of the encounter. Both films, therefore, grapple with the documentary paradox: the attempt to capture authentic testimony is always mediated by the filmmaker’s framing, objectives, and the unequal dynamics of the recording situation itself.

### 4.3 Mediating Transition: The Body, Medical Authority, and Coerced Narratives

The representation of the physical and institutional process of transition is where the political critique of *Be Like Others* becomes most potent, directly engaging with the mechanics of state power. The film is set against Iran’s unique legal-religious framework, established by a 1987 fatwa from Ayatollah Khomeini, which permits SRS as a “cure” for “diagnosed transsexuals” while criminalizing homosexuality[^39]. The documentary meticulously charts the state’s **coercive pathway**: individuals must submit to evaluations by the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization, a six-month process designed to filter out those deemed homosexual and certify others as truly transgender[^38]. Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali explicitly describes this gatekeeping function, claiming the arduous nature of the process helps identify “actual gay men” who rarely proceed[^41].

The film’s central irony, as noted in critical analyses, is that this “liberating” medical technology is simultaneously a profound instrument of government control over sexuality and the body[^12]. The camera mediates this coercion in several ways. First, it presents **graphic descriptions of the surgical procedure** from the doctor, detailing its difficulty and pain, which underscores the extreme physical cost of gaining social legitimacy[^12][^3]. Second, it captures the **performative disavowal of homosexuality** by subjects, who internalize and vocalize the state’s pathologizing narrative to access the only legally permissible identity[^39][^17]. As one review summarizes, the state’s pro-trans position aims “to abolish homosexuality by ensuring a particular form of trans identity that fits the gender binary”[^38]. The body in transition is thus framed not solely as a site of personal affirmation but as a **terrain of political negotiation**, where biological alteration becomes a prerequisite for a livable life.

*Cinema Fouad* approaches the theme of transition from a different angle, emphasizing personal aspiration and economic precarity rather than systemic coercion. Khaled El Kurdi expresses her desire for gender reassignment surgery as a personal goal[^40]. However, the film contextualizes this desire within her reality as a migrant worker and performer in Beirut. The transition is not depicted through medical procedures but through the **daily rituals of self-fashioning**—applying makeup, dancing—which become acts of claiming identity amidst limited options[^1]. The economic barrier to surgery is implicit in her life circumstances. This contrasts sharply with Iran’s state-subsidized but ideologically filtered process. In *Be Like Others*, the system dictates the narrative; in *Cinema Fouad*, the lack of a supportive system shapes the narrative as one of individual yearning and struggle. Both films, however, mediate the transgender body through the constraints of its environment: in one, the body is processed by the state; in the other, the body seeks transformation despite the state’s absence or indifference.

### 4.4 Beyond Trauma: Documenting Resilience, Community, and the Search for Joy

While both documentaries unflinchingly document hardship, a critical reading reveals their efforts to move beyond a reductive trauma narrative to capture resilience, fleeting joy, and the complex fabric of daily life. *Cinema Fouad* achieves this through its focus on **embodied expression and domestic ritual**. Scenes of Khaled El Kurdi belly dancing in her room are not merely performances for the camera; they are depicted as acts of self-possession, creativity, and cultural connection[^1][^40]. The application of makeup and the careful curation of her appearance are framed as intimate practices of world-making within the confines of her private space. These moments construct a counter-narrative to the external aggression she describes, highlighting her agency in cultivating beauty and identity amidst adversity. The film becomes an archive not of victimhood, but of **persistent self-creation**.

*Be Like Others* navigates this terrain by presenting divergent outcomes, thereby resisting a singular, tragic arc. The film does not shy away from devastating stories like that of Ali/Negar, who states, “I have killed the love in my life,” and who turns to sex work via temporary marriage contracts after being disowned[^17][^3]. However, it also dedicates significant time to Anoosh/Anahita, who appears happy and engaged, and to the figure of Vida, who presents herself as reborn and fulfilled post-transition[^39]. The director’s inclusion of a man she met during filming who chose to live as a gay man rather than transition, and whom she later tried to help leave Iran, further complicates the narrative, suggesting alternative forms of resistance and identity outside the state’s binary solution[^39]. The film’s power lies in this **refusal to simplify**, documenting a spectrum where medical transition can be a path to a desired life for some, a coerced survival strategy for others, and a choice rejected by yet others.

This perspective challenges the viewer to see beyond the sensational paradox of Iran’s laws. The documentaries function not as mere exposés but as **complex portraits that document the strategies of survival and the search for dignity**. They capture the ambiguous spaces where identity is negotiated—in a Tehran clinic, a Beirut bedroom, or through the bonds of chosen or strained familial relationships. By doing so, *Be Like Others* and *Cinema Fouad* contribute to a more nuanced archive of transgender experience in the MENA region, one that acknowledges systemic violence without reducing its subjects to passive victims, and that finds value in documenting resilience, creativity, and the ongoing struggle for self-determination.

## 5 Close Analysis II: Narrative Fiction and the Trans Imaginary

This chapter conducts a detailed textual and formal analysis of Negar Azarbayjani's 2011 film *Facing Mirrors*, the first Iranian narrative feature with a transgender protagonist[^27]. The analysis focuses on how this fictional work employs the road trip genre, confined mise-en-scène, and character development to imagine trans subjectivity and explore the intersection of gender identity with familial duty, class, and state power in Iran. It investigates the film's strategic narrative choices—such as its focus on an unlikely cross-class friendship, its avoidance of the 'deception and revelation' trope, and its humanistic framing of the state's paradoxical medical policies—to understand how it constructs a trans imaginary that challenges both local social taboos and Western Orientalist expectations of MENA queer narratives. This chapter builds upon the theoretical frameworks and contextual constraints established earlier, demonstrating how narrative fiction can function as a site for complex social negotiation and the articulation of agency within repressive environments.

### 5.1 Genre as Vehicle: The Road Trip and the Confined Space of Negotiation

*Facing Mirrors* strategically utilizes the road trip genre and the confined mise-en-scène of a taxi to structure its exploration of trans subjectivity and social conflict[^42][^27]. The plot centers on an accidental journey shared by two women from opposite ends of the social spectrum: Rana, an inexperienced, religious, and tradition-bound wife who is forced to drive a taxi to support her family while her husband is imprisoned for debt; and Adineh (Eddie), a wealthy, rebellious pre-operative transgender man fleeing his home and an impending arranged marriage[^42][^27]. The taxi becomes a **liminal space**, a mobile bubble where rigid social hierarchies and class barriers are temporarily suspended, forcing an intimate encounter that would be socially impossible in their normal lives[^27]. This formal choice, noted in reviews as creating a 'character-driven' drama, allows the film to bypass the sensational 'deception and revelation' plot common in Western transgender narratives[^27]. Instead of a thriller-like structure focused on the shock of discovery, the slow-burn narrative within the moving vehicle facilitates a gradual, transformative empathy that cuts across ethical and class divides, as highlighted in the Frameline program note which states their friendship achieves "rare sympathy and solidarity through their mutual oppression"[^27].

The journey's physical confinement becomes a narrative engine for challenging prejudice. The initial panic and rejection occur within this space: when Eddie reveals he is "trans," Rana's shock causes her to drive into a bus[^27]. However, the subsequent necessity of sharing this confined space for survival and travel forces a prolonged interaction. Scenes within the taxi shift from being a site of cultural clash—contrasting Eddie's casual modernity with Rana's traditional shock—to becoming a crucible for understanding[^27]. The road trip genre, a key motif in modern Iranian cinema, is repurposed here not for adventure but for intimate social negotiation[^27]. The narrative tension derives not from external chase sequences but from the internal evolution of a relationship within a defined space, eschewing thriller elements to explore what these two very different people find they have in common: a willingness to stand against social convention[^27]. This spatial strategy allows the film to construct a microcosm of Iranian society, where the negotiation of gender, class, and belief is played out in close quarters, making the personal journey inseparable from the social one.

### 5.2 Character, Agency, and the Subversion of the Tragic Trope

The film meticulously constructs agency in its central characters, Adineh/Eddie and Rana, actively subverting the pervasive 'tragic transgender' stereotype. Eddie is portrayed not as a passive victim of Iran's legal paradox but as an individual actively pursuing self-determination. He explains that sex reassignment surgery is legal and state-subsidized in Iran, but he seeks it in Germany specifically to escape the control of his wealthy, transphobic father who is determined to marry him off to a male cousin[^27]. This narrative choice highlights **defiance and strategic action** rather than helplessness. This agency is embodied in Shayesteh Irani's "magnetic, heartbreaking" performance, which masterfully balances vulnerability with resolute determination, avoiding both sentimentality and stereotype[^27]. Specific scenes underscore this: when stopped by the "Guidance Patrol," Eddie confronts the police and attempts to use his brother's driver's license, an act of resistance against state authority[^27]. The character avoids being objectified as an exotic or pitiful figure; instead, he is complex, exercising choice within severe constraints[^27].

Similarly, Rana's arc is one of emerging agency rooted in her own experience of gendered oppression. Initially bound by tradition and panic, her journey evolves from a financial necessity into an act of solidarity and self-assertion. Her decision to drive a taxi itself defies the taboos of her social class and the disapproval of her mother-in-law[^27]. Her initial reaction to Eddie—hitting him in hysteria while explaining, "I thought you were a man and tricked me"—stems from her own fears as a woman violating gender roles to ensure her family's safety[^27]. However, this fear becomes a point of connection rather than permanent division. As noted in one analysis, Rana's support for Eddie becomes "an unexpected source of fearlessness," allowing her to regain a sense of purpose lost after her husband's imprisonment[^27]. By crafting this **unlikely alliance**, the film demonstrates how solidarity can form across profound difference, challenging both local patriarchal norms that isolate women and gender minorities and the Western Orientalist gaze that consumes MENA queer stories as monolithic narratives of passive victimhood[^27]. This point is explicitly made in comparative analyses that contrast *Facing Mirrors* with films like *Circumstance*, which are criticized for reducing Iranian queer characters to sexualized objects of a Western savior fantasy[^27].

### 5.3 Mise-en-Scène of Identity: Mirrors, Fabric, and the Performance of Self

The film's visual language is rich with symbolism that articulates gender identity as a performative, embodied, and often contested process. The recurring motif of **mirrors** is central, as highlighted in the title and noted in analyses for "highlighting the search for one’s identity"[^27]. Scenes of characters looking at themselves in mirrors are not mere vanity shots but moments of profound self-interrogation and recognition. For Eddie, the mirror reflects the dissonance between his internal male identity and his external female appearance, a site of both dysphoria and the conscious performance of self. For Rana, the mirror may reflect her internal conflict between her prescribed traditional role and her newfound, unconventional agency as a driver and protector. These reflective surfaces become metaphors for the film's core dynamic: facing oneself and, by extension, facing the "other" in a way that reveals shared humanity[^42][^27].

Complementing this, the mise-en-scène heavily features **fabric, clothing, and tailoring** as extensions of identity. Eddie's careful binding of his chest, his choice of masculine attire like shorts and baseball caps, and his use of his brother's ID are all visual cues of his gender expression and the daily labor of aligning appearance with identity[^27]. This connects powerfully to broader theoretical concepts of gender performativity, where identity is constituted through repeated stylized acts. The film visually materializes this theory. Furthermore, the act of tailoring itself—a craft associated with precision, transformation, and covering the body—becomes a potent metaphor. In a broader cinematic context, this resonates with films like *The Blue Caftan*, where the meticulous crafting of a garment parallels the delicate, often hidden, construction of queer desire and self[^5][^7]. In *Facing Mirrors*, Eddie's androgynous care for Rana during her recovery achieves a kind of gender fusion in the role of the caregiver, a subtlety enhanced by Irani's performance[^27]. The focus on domestic and personal spaces—bedrooms, bathrooms, the taxi's interior—underscores the intimate, private scale at which these battles of identity and expression are fought, reinforcing the film's humanistic approach by grounding its political themes in the tangible details of everyday life[^27].

### 5.4 Navigating the State's Paradox: Humanism vs. Coercion in the Narrative Frame

*Facing Mirrors* operates within and critically engages Iran's unique legal and religious stance on transgender issues, navigating a delicate line between humanistic portrayal and implicit critique of state coercion. The film explicitly references the legal framework: a trivia note from the producer at the end states that "according to unofficial statistics, one in every 200,000 children in Iran is born transgender," and that "Iran supports these individuals from a medical and logical point of view as per Imam Khomeini's Fatwa," making surgery accessible with government loans[^42]. This message aligns with the state's official narrative. Within the diegesis, Eddie explains the legality and availability of surgery in Iran[^27]. However, the plot subverts this official sanction by revealing its coercive social context. Eddie seeks surgery in Germany not because Iranian medicine is inadequate, but because his wealthy father, humiliated by his transgender identity, is using the same state-sanctioned system to force him into an arranged marriage, effectively imprisoning him within the gender assigned at birth[^27].

This creates a core narrative tension: the state provides a technological "solution" (surgery) that is simultaneously embedded within patriarchal family structures that seek to deny individual autonomy. The film thus exposes the **medical-industrial complex** not through direct confrontation but through the personal story of someone caught in its contradictions. Eddie's journey is not a celebration of state policy but an escape from its entanglement with familial control. The film's "humanistic look," as described by the producer, functions as a strategic framework[^42]. By focusing on the relatable emotional bonds, personal struggles, and growing empathy between Eddie and Rana, the film makes a transgender narrative palatable and emotionally accessible within Iran's restrictive cultural and censorship landscape[^27]. This tactic allowed it to insert a nuanced queer narrative into the public sphere, leading to domestic critical acclaim, widespread debate, and even screenings in religious institutions like Mofid University in Qom, where it was praised for portraying the realities of trans lives[^27]. Therefore, *Facing Mirrors* achieves a complex feat: it utilizes the state's own sanctioned discourse on transgender identity as a premise, then employs humanist storytelling to explore the personal and social conflicts that this very system generates, thereby challenging prejudice without directly attacking state policy. This nuanced navigation helps explain its significant impact both within Iran and on the international festival circuit, where it won numerous awards including the Outstanding First Feature Award at Frameline[^42][^27].

## 6 Close Analysis III: Short Films and Diasporic Aesthetics

This chapter conducts a detailed formal and thematic analysis of Amrou Al-Kadhi's short film *Run(a)way Arab* (2018) to investigate how the condensed format of the short film and the diasporic perspective generate unique aesthetic and political strategies for representing transgender and genderqueer experiences. The analysis focuses on the film's experimental narrative structure, which interweaves the present-day preparations of drag queen Queen Za Dream with flashbacks of the protagonist's childhood gender transgressions, to articulate the complex intersection of gender identity with race, migration, and memory. Drawing directly on the detailed plot summaries, production context, and filmmaker statements from the reference materials, this chapter examines how the film employs visual motifs (Egyptian deity-inspired drag, maternal cosmetics), temporal layering, and a minimalist aesthetic to explore themes of intergenerational connection, cultural transmission, and the healing power of performance. It positions the short film as a vital site for challenging Western expectations of 'trauma porn' in MENA queer narratives, instead foregrounding a diasporic aesthetics of ambiguity, hybridity, and the preservation of love amidst painful contradictions. This chapter advances the report's argument by demonstrating how formal experimentation in short and diasporic cinema enables nuanced engagements with identity that resist both local patriarchal norms and Orientalist consumption.

### 6.1 Formal Experimentation: Flashbacks, Fragmentation, and the Performance of Memory

*Run(a)way Arab* employs a sophisticated, fragmented narrative structure that is central to its exploration of memory, identity, and healing. The film’s 12-minute runtime is densely packed with a dialectical montage between two temporalities: the present-day, where 26-year-old Nazeem, performing as the Middle Eastern drag queen Queen Za Dream, prepares for a show with "the utmost gravity" in an outfit "evocative of an Egyptian deity"[^29][^33]; and the past, where an 8-year-old genderqueer Nazeem shares a close bond with his Iraqi-Egyptian mother, Halima[^29]. This interweaving is not merely a flashback device but the film's core formal and psychological engine. The editing creates a dialogue between the adult's artistic ritual and the child's formative, traumatic moment of gender transgression. **The fragmentation mirrors the protagonist's own fragmented sense of self, caught between cultural expectations, maternal love, and an innate gender identity that defies simple categorization**[^43].

The film’s economy of storytelling, necessitated by the short format, is masterful. Key emotional and narrative information is conveyed through visuals and gesture rather than exposition. Notably, **the adult Nazeem never speaks a single word throughout the film**[^44][^45]. His interiority and the weight of his past are communicated through the solemn, ritualistic focus of his preparation—applying makeup, adjusting his elaborate costume—and through the poignant contrast with the childhood scenes. This minimalist approach forces the viewer to engage with the visual and emotional subtext. As one featured user review notes, the film's "basic virtue" lies in its "gentle touch of storytelling," including its use of "music, gestures, and work of the camera"[^46]. The "bitterness of the story," defined by "the loneliness of the boy and his curiosity," is thus felt rather than explained[^46][^43]. The formal choice to silence the adult protagonist can be read as a representation of the unspeakable nature of his childhood wound and the subsequent internalization of that pain. His voice finds expression not in speech, but in the transformative, non-verbal language of drag performance.

**The film’s structure posits drag not merely as entertainment or rebellion, but as a profound psychological mechanism for processing trauma and preserving memory.** The synopsis repeatedly states that "only through his drag is the adult Nazeem able to keep sacred the memories of his mother before this painful moment, and hold on to their connection"[^29][^39]. The act of becoming Queen Za Dream is thus framed as a therapeutic ritual. The meticulous preparation—a performance in itself—becomes a way to revisit, reorder, and reclaim the past. The childhood fascination with his mother's "makeup and clothes," which leads to the painful rupture, is transfigured in adulthood into a controlled, artistic mastery of those same signifiers of femininity and glamour[^47][^43]. The film suggests that through the aesthetic self-fashioning of drag, Nazeem can access and preserve the pre-traumatic bond with his mother, healing the rupture by integrating the forbidden childhood desire into a powerful adult identity.

### 6.2 Drag as Diasporic Aesthetics: Hybridity, Cultural Reclamation, and Queer Arab Joy

*Run(a)way Arab* constructs drag as a specific diasporic aesthetic, a site where multiple, often contradictory, identities are negotiated and synthesized. Queen Za Dream’s persona is a deliberate hybrid. Her stage outfit is not generically glamorous but is specifically "evocative of an Egyptian deity"[^33]. This choice is significant: it reclaims and re-imagines an iconography from Arab heritage, infusing it with queer, contemporary meaning. The drag performance becomes a channel to connect with a cultural past, but on the performer's own, transformative terms. This aligns with director Amrou Al-Kadhi's own description of drag as "an amazing tool for healing" that helped them "connect to their Iraqi heritage," allowing access to parts of that heritage "inaccessible to them as someone assigned male at birth"[^48]. In the film, drag enables Nazeem to merge his queer identity with his Arab heritage, creating a new, empowered synthesis that exists within a Western queer subculture (the film is set and produced in the UK[^33][^47]) but is not subsumed by it.

The film actively resists the pressure to conform to Western expectations of MENA queer narratives as primarily tales of trauma and conflict. Al-Kadhi has been vocal about this pressure, stating that in the UK, people have assumptions that "queer Arab work probably has a lot of trauma," so when comedy or other genres are pitched, "it often doesn't fit the white commissioner's idea of what a queer Arab work should look like"[^44][^49]. *Run(a)way Arab* counters this by foregrounding what Al-Kadhi elsewhere terms "queer, Arab joy" and the "abundance" of intersectional identity[^48]. While the film deals with a painful childhood memory, its present-day focus is on creation, preparation, and the sacred act of performance. The trauma is not the spectacle; the resilience and creative transformation are. **The film’s aesthetic celebrates ambiguity and the "magic of contradiction," holding "perceived oppositional things beside each other"—a space Al-Kadhi believes is "where progress happens"**[^48].

This diasporic aesthetics challenges binary representations on two fronts. First, it complicates monolithic notions of Arab identity, showing it as a source of both strict gender norms (embodied by Halima's conflicted nature) and rich cultural material for queer reinvention (the Egyptian deity motif). Second, it expands the representation of queerness beyond Western paradigms, presenting a specifically Arab diasporic queer subjectivity that is shaped by migration, memory, and a complex relationship to the homeland and its traditions. The film offers a model of diasporic expression that does not seek to resolve contradiction but embraces hybridity as a source of strength, creativity, and beauty.

### 6.3 The Maternal Nexus: Gender Transgression, Intergenerational Conflict, and the Preservation of Love

The emotional core of *Run(a)way Arab* is the complex, fraught relationship between Nazeem and his mother, Halima. Halima is described as a figure of profound contradiction: "flamboyant and in many ways a drag queen herself on the surface," yet ultimately "governed by the strict expectations of gender in Arab society"[^29][^39]. This duality makes her both Nazeem's first model of gender performance and the agent of his deepest wound. Their close bond is shattered when the young Nazeem, inspired by his mother, transgresses gender boundaries. Halima's reaction is described as "utterly confusing to him"[^29][^33]—a rejection that is likely rooted in her own internalized policing of those same societal norms she superficially plays with. This pivotal moment represents the violent intrusion of patriarchal cultural mandates into the intimate space of the mother-child relationship.

The film's great nuance lies in its refusal to cast Halima as a simple villain. Her reaction stems from "her love, her fears" about her son's image and future in a hostile world[^43]. The conflict is portrayed as a tragedy of love constrained by fear. This intergenerational dynamic serves as a microcosm of the larger negotiation between queer identity and cultural tradition. The pain originates not from a lack of love, but from love's entanglement with societal preservation. **The film suggests that the mother, herself performing gender within a strict framework, becomes the unwitting enforcer of that framework upon her child, creating a rupture that defines the protagonist's sense of self and loss.**

The adult Nazeem's drag practice is the film's proposed response to this rupture. It is not an act of rebellion against the mother, but a complex ritual of preservation and reconnection. As multiple synopses state, through drag he "keep[s] sacred the memories of his mother before this painful moment"[^39][^41]. By channeling the very femininity and flamboyance he associated with his mother—the makeup, the clothes, the performance—into his art, Nazeem resurrects and honors the version of her that existed before fear dictated her actions. He holds on to their connection by integrating her essence into his own identity. In this way, the film portrays a love that persists despite and through profound misunderstanding and pain. The final image is not of reconciliation but of sacred, solitary preparation, suggesting that the work of healing and preserving love is an ongoing, internal performance.

### 6.4 Diasporic Constraints and Creative Autonomy: Funding, Circulation, and Counter-Narratives

The production and circulation of *Run(a)way Arab* exemplify both the constraints and the creative potentials of diasporic queer filmmaking. The film was produced by Fox Cub Films in the UK[^33][^47], a model that provided a degree of autonomy outside the funding and censorship structures of the Arab world. However, as Al-Kadhi's statements indicate, diasporic filmmakers still face significant pressures from Western funding bodies that expect "trauma porn" from queer Middle Eastern stories[^44][^49]. The very existence and aesthetic of *Run(a)way Arab*—with its focus on interiority, memory, and artistic transformation over explicit conflict—can be seen as a direct counter to these expectations.

The film navigated these constraints by leveraging alternative networks of circulation. It achieved visibility through a robust festival run, including prestigious LGBTQ+ and short film festivals such as the London Short Film Festival, BFI Flare, OutFest LA, and the Melbourne Queer Film Festival[^39][^41][^48]. This festival circuit is a critical lifeline for diasporic and queer cinema, providing validation, audience, and a platform for community building. Subsequently, the film became available on niche streaming platforms like Revry, a LGBTQ+ focused service[^29]. It was also edited into the compilation *Boys on Film 19: No Ordinary Boy* (2019)[^33][^46], further embedding it within curated queer cinematic traditions.

**This circulation strategy allows the film to bypass traditional commercial gatekeepers and reach its intended, often niche, audiences directly.** It functions as a counter-narrative not only in content but in its very mode of distribution. It builds community among diasporic and queer viewers who seek representations that reflect their complex realities. The film's journey from UK production to international festival acclaim and targeted streaming availability maps a viable pathway for diasporic artists to maintain creative control while finding their audience. In doing so, *Run(a)way Arab* demonstrates how the short film format, combined with diasporic perspective and alternative distribution, can create a space for nuanced, resistant storytelling that challenges both the patriarchal norms of the imagined homeland and the reductive, often Orientalist, consumption habits of mainstream Western cultural markets.

## 7 Comparative Synthesis: Patterns, Tensions, and Innovations in Representation

This chapter synthesizes the findings from the close readings of individual films to identify overarching patterns, narrative tropes, and representational strategies across the corpus of MENA trans cinema. It conducts a comparative analysis of the documentary and narrative fiction works discussed in previous chapters, focusing on the central tensions between visibility and exploitation, local specificity and transnational appeal, and resistance versus assimilation within these cinematic texts. The analysis leverages the detailed information from the reference materials on films like *Be Like Others*, *Cinema Fouad*, *Facing Mirrors*, *Run(a)way Arab*, *The Blue Caftan*, and *Joyland* to map a spectrum of representational modes—from systemic critique and intimate portraiture to genre subversion and diasporic aesthetics. This synthesis aims to distill the key innovations and persistent challenges in representing transgender lives in the MENA region, highlighting how these films collectively negotiate the complex interplay of identity, power, and cultural context.

### 7.1 Mapping the Spectrum: Documentary Exposé vs. Narrative Empathy

The corpus of MENA trans cinema reveals a distinct spectrum of representational strategies, anchored at one end by the documentary exposé and at the other by narrative empathy. This divergence is not merely a matter of format but reflects fundamentally different approaches to truth, ethics, and the cinematic mediation of transgender experience.

**The Documentary Exposé and the Systemic Gaze** is exemplified by Tanaz Eshaghian’s *Be Like Others* (2008). This film functions as a critical exposé of Iran’s unique and paradoxical legal-medical framework, where sex reassignment surgery is state-sanctioned and subsidized while homosexuality is punishable by death[^3]. The film’s power derives from its adoption of a **clinical, systemic gaze**. It is anchored in the Mirdamad Surgical Center, where the camera observes the arduous, six-month filtering process administered by the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization[^3]. This gaze objectifies the process, framing patients as medical cases within an institutional setting. The film meticulously documents the coercive dynamic where individuals, like Ali (later Negar), may pursue surgery not solely from self-determined gender affirmation but as a socially sanctioned alternative to a persecuted gay identity[^3]. Patients and post-operative counselors like Vida are shown vehemently distancing themselves from homosexuality, internalizing and vocalizing the state’s pathologizing narrative to claim legitimacy[^3]. The documentary thus operates as a sociological critique, exposing how the **medical-industrial complex** functions as an instrument of state control over sexuality and identity.

**Narrative Empathy and the Humanistic Focus** represents the opposite pole, prioritizing character-driven intimacy and psychological interiority. Negar Azarbayjani’s *Facing Mirrors* (2011), the first Iranian narrative film with a transgender protagonist, exemplifies this approach[^5]. Instead of a systemic critique, the film constructs a humanistic drama centered on the unlikely friendship between Adineh (Eddie), a pre-operative transgender man, and Rana, a conservative female taxi driver[^4]. The narrative unfolds within the confined space of the taxi, fostering a slow-building empathy that cuts across profound class and ethical differences[^5]. This focus on personal connection and emotional transformation aims to challenge prejudice through relatable human experience rather than political argument. Similarly, Maryam Touzani’s *The Blue Caftan* (2022) explores queer desire through the intimate, tactile world of a master tailor’s workshop, focusing on the unspoken bonds between husband, wife, and apprentice[^5][^7]. These films use narrative fiction to cultivate empathy and explore the interior landscapes of their characters, offering a counterpoint to the detached observation of the documentary exposé.

**Hybrid Forms and Evolving Aesthetics** occupy the middle ground, blending documentary impulses with innovative formal strategies. Mohamed Soueid’s *Cinema Fouad* (1993) presents an intimate documentary portrait of Khaled El Kurdi, a Syrian trans woman in Beirut, but complicates its own gaze by highlighting the subject’s defiance against the filmmaker’s “goading questions”[^1]. This creates a self-reflexive critique of the documentary encounter itself. More recently, Mohamad Abdouni’s *Treat Me Like Your Mother* (2025) moves decisively toward a **celebratory archive**, weaving personal photographs, home videos, and collaborative testimony to document trans resilience in Lebanon, consciously shifting focus from trauma to community and survival[^2]. These hybrid forms demonstrate an evolution in representational ethics, seeking to balance visibility with a more collaborative and affirmative mode of storytelling.

### 7.2 The Visibility Paradox: Between Exposure, Exploitation, and Agency

A central and persistent tension across MENA trans cinema is the **visibility paradox**: the political necessity of making transgender lives seen versus the ethical risks of exploitation, entrapment, and the loss of subject agency. This paradox manifests differently across documentary and narrative forms, reflecting the fraught power dynamics inherent in representing marginalized communities.

In documentary, this tension is acute. *Be Like Others* provides crucial visibility to a state-sanctioned system, yet its ethical terrain is complex. The film’s subjects, in their struggle for social legitimacy, often articulate views that align with state ideology, such as Vida’s role in counseling patients and potentially acting as a “government mouthpiece”[^3]. Their testimonies, while authentic expressions of their lived reality within a coercive framework, risk reinforcing the very pathologizing narratives the film might otherwise critique. The director, Tanaz Eshaghian, occupies a dual position as an Iranian-American returnee, which grants access but also places her in a complex intermediary role[^3]. Similarly, *Cinema Fouad* captures this tension within the interview dynamic itself. The film acknowledges that Khaled El Kurdi’s defiance mirrors the external aggression she faces, suggesting the documentary process can inadvertently replicate the power structures it seeks to illuminate[^1]. These films highlight the ethical tightrope walked by documentarians: exposure can empower, but it can also extract and instrumentalize personal trauma for an external audience.

Narrative fiction, by contrast, constructs agency within its diegetic world, though this agency is often circumscribed by the very social structures the films depict. In *Facing Mirrors*, Eddie’s agency is defined by strategic action—he flees his father’s control and seeks surgery in Germany to escape an arranged marriage, actively pursuing self-determination despite immense pressure[^5]. The film humanizes his struggle, presenting him not as a victim but as a complex individual navigating limited choices. **Joyland** (2022) presents a different model of disruptive agency through Biba, a transgender dancer whose presence catalyzes a crisis within a traditional Lahori family[^5]. Her character challenges social norms and becomes a focal point of desire and transgression, though her story also ends in tragedy, reflecting the perilous reality of such visibility in Pakistan. These narrative constructions of agency serve a dual purpose: they provide empowering representations for trans audiences and foster empathy among cisgender viewers by centering trans subjectivity and resilience.

The paradox is further intensified by the external realities of production and reception. Filmmakers must navigate **digital targeting and censorship**, where visibility can lead to real-world harm for subjects and audiences alike[^2]. The reference materials detail how security forces in countries like Egypt and Lebanon use social media and dating apps to entrap LGBTQ+ individuals[^2]. This climate makes the act of filming and viewing such content inherently risky. In response, innovative distribution strategies emerge, such as the secret, speakeasy-style screenings organized for ArabQ Films’ *The Wedding*, which implemented strict safety protocols including NDAs, ID checks, and phone bans[^2]. These measures underscore the high stakes of visibility: while cinematic representation is a powerful tool for social change, it operates within a landscape where exposure can be a direct threat to safety and liberty.

### 7.3 Negotiating the Local and the Transnational: Specificity vs. Appeal

MENA trans films operate within a dual address, strategically negotiating the demands of **local cultural specificity** and **transnational, often festival-driven, appeal**. This negotiation shapes narrative content, aesthetic choices, and the very conditions of production and circulation, creating a dynamic interplay between rooted authenticity and global legibility.

A prime example of deep local embeddedness is *Facing Mirrors*. The film achieved significant domestic impact within Iran, garnering critical acclaim and sparking widespread public debate[^4]. Its narrative is deeply interwoven with local socio-legal realities, explicitly referencing the fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini that permits gender reassignment surgery[^4]. Remarkably, it was even screened and discussed in religious institutions like Mofid University in Qom, indicating its ability to engage with local discourses on gender and morality on their own terms[^4]. This local resonance, however, did not preclude transnational success. The film won international awards, including the “Best First Feature” at the Frameline Festival, demonstrating how a story grounded in specific Iranian contradictions can generate universal empathy and recognition on the festival circuit[^4][^5].

In contrast, diasporic productions like *Run(a)way Arab* (2018) and *Kelet* (2020) articulate **hybrid identities** from a position outside the homeland. *Run(a)way Arab* explores the connection between a Middle Eastern drag queen’s art and his childhood memories of his Iraqi-Egyptian mother, navigating the “strict expectations of gender in Arab society”[^8]. Its aesthetic, blending contemporary drag with allusions to Egyptian deities, speaks to a diasporic experience of cultural reclamation and reinvention. Director Amrou Al-Kadhi has explicitly discussed resisting Western commissioners’ expectations of “trauma porn” from queer Arab stories, instead focusing on “queer, Arab joy” and the “magic of contradiction”[^8]. Similarly, *Kelet* follows a Somali trans woman building a new life in Finland, supported by the Vogue ballroom community[^9]. These films are inherently transnational, created in and for diasporic and global queer audiences, and their circulation is heavily dependent on international film festivals like BFI Flare, OutFest LA, and NewFest[^8][^9].

The material constraints of funding further dictate this negotiation. The research indicates that **a large portion of funding for Middle Eastern LGBTQ+ films comes from Western institutions**, as local funders often deem such projects “too queer”[^2]. This reliance shapes creative output. The launch of ArabQ Films, the first Arab-based production company solely dedicated to queer narratives, represents a significant attempt to create an institutional platform from within the region, though it too received funding from an anonymous Egyptian producer[^2]. Its mandate requiring self-identified queer directors or lead producers aims to ensure authentic authorship[^2]. However, the need for transnational appeal to secure festival slots and international distribution can also incentivize narratives that conform to certain global expectations of what queer Middle Eastern stories should look like, creating a potential tension between authentic specificity and marketable appeal.

### 7.4 Innovations in Form: Subverting Tropes and Forging New Aesthetics

MENA trans cinema distinguishes itself through formal and narrative innovations that actively subvert dominant Western tropes and forge new aesthetic languages for transgender experience. These innovations represent conscious strategies to challenge stereotypical portrayals, explore complex subjectivities, and articulate identities that exist at the intersection of multiple cultural pressures.

**Subversion of the ‘Deception and Revelation’ Trope** is a key innovation. Western narratives often derive dramatic tension from the shock of a transgender character’s “big reveal,” framing trans identity as inherently deceptive. *Facing Mirrors* deliberately avoids this plot. The film’s central relationship between Eddie and Rana is not built on deception but on a forced intimacy that gradually erodes prejudice[^5]. The narrative pleasure comes not from a thriller-like unveiling but from witnessing the slow, hard-won development of empathy and solidarity across a vast social chasm. This subversion is a political act, rejecting the pathologizing link between transgender identity and deceit, and instead constructing a narrative where understanding is earned through shared humanity and mutual oppression.

**The Use of Fragmented Temporality and Non-Verbal Expression** is another significant formal innovation, particularly in short and diasporic films. *Run(a)way Arab* employs a dialectical montage between the adult drag queen’s ritualistic preparation and flashbacks of his childhood gender transgression[^8]. This structure externalizes the process of memory and healing, positing drag performance as a therapeutic act of preserving a sacred maternal connection. Crucially, the adult protagonist **never speaks**, conveying his interiority solely through gesture, focus, and the transformative act of applying makeup and adjusting his costume[^8]. This minimalist, non-verbal approach forces a visual and emotional engagement, moving beyond explanatory dialogue to capture the ineffable qualities of identity formation and the preservation of love amidst pain.

**Symbolic Mise-en-Scène and Metaphoric Craft** provide a rich, non-explicit language for exploring desire and identity. In both *Facing Mirrors* and *The Blue Caftan*, fabric, clothing, and the act of tailoring become central metaphors. Eddie’s careful binding and choice of attire in *Facing Mirrors* visually materialize the daily labor of aligning appearance with identity[^5]. In *The Blue Caftan*, the meticulous, almost sacred process of crafting a garment becomes a parallel for the delicate, hidden construction of queer desire and the unspoken bonds within a marriage[^5][^7]. This use of craft and material culture allows films to explore intimate themes within culturally specific contexts, offering a nuanced aesthetic that speaks through symbolism rather than explicit depiction.

**The Shift to a Celebratory, Archival Aesthetic** marks a forward-looking innovation. *Treat Me Like Your Mother* represents this evolution, consciously moving away from trauma-centric representation[^2]. The film functions as a collaborative “photographic scrapbook,” weaving personal archives, home videos, and testimony to document trans resilience and community in Lebanon[^2]. By centering celebration, friendship, and survival, this aesthetic counters the expectation of perpetual victimhood and creates an affirmative historical record for and by the community. It represents a powerful reclamation of narrative authority, forging an aesthetic of joy and resilience as a form of political resistance and cultural preservation.

## 8 Conclusion: Future Projections for Trans Cinema and Scholarship

This concluding chapter synthesizes the core arguments of this research, reflecting on the distinctive contributions of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) transgender cinema to global queer film and theory. The analysis has charted a cinematic terrain marked by profound negotiation, where films from *Cinema Fouad* (1993) to *Treat Me Like Your Mother* (2025) engage with the lived realities of transgender individuals amidst complex socio-legal landscapes. By integrating frameworks from transgender studies—such as critiques of the medical-industrial complex, theories of embodiment, and the trans of color critique—with film theory's tools for analyzing narrative, gaze, and genre, this paper has demonstrated how these works are not merely representations but active sites of cultural and political negotiation. The identified patterns, from the systemic exposé to the humanistic drama and the diasporic aesthetic of hybridity, reveal a corpus that consistently challenges both local patriarchal norms and Western Orientalist expectations. As this cinematic tradition continues to evolve, it prompts critical questions about its future trajectories in scholarship, production, and socio-political impact.

### 8.1 Synthesizing the Argument: Key Contributions of MENA Trans Cinema

The analysis across this paper reveals that MENA trans cinema makes several pivotal contributions to global cinematic and academic discourse. **Foremost, it functions as a crucial counter-archive, documenting transgender lives and resilience within contexts often rendered invisible or hyper-visible only through a lens of trauma.** Films like *Be Like Others* and *Facing Mirrors* provide indispensable insights into the paradoxical realities of places like Iran, where state-sanctioned surgery exists alongside the criminalization of homosexuality, exposing how identity is filtered through a coercive medical-industrial complex. These narratives move beyond sensationalism to explore the nuanced, often painful, negotiations individuals undertake for social legitimacy and survival.

**Secondly, this corpus actively subverts dominant Western representational tropes.** A key finding is the strategic avoidance of the "deception and revelation" plot. *Facing Mirrors* derives its narrative power not from the shock of a transgender reveal but from the slow-building empathy between Eddie and Rana within the confined space of a taxi, forging solidarity across class and ethical divides. Similarly, diasporic works like *Run(a)way Arab* reject pressure to produce "trauma porn" for Western commissioners, instead foregrounding "queer, Arab joy" and the therapeutic, memory-preserving power of drag performance. This represents a conscious aesthetic and political choice to define representation on its own terms.

**Thirdly, these films illuminate the intricate negotiation between local specificity and transnational appeal.** *Facing Mirrors* achieved resonance within Iran, sparking debate in religious institutions, while also succeeding on the international festival circuit. This dual address demonstrates how stories rooted in specific socio-legal contradictions can generate universal empathy. Meanwhile, diasporic films navigate hybrid identities, reclaiming cultural iconography (e.g., Egyptian deity-inspired drag) to articulate complex subjectivities shaped by migration, memory, and belonging.

**Finally, MENA trans cinema highlights the persistent and dangerous "visibility paradox."** While cinematic representation is a vital tool for advocacy and community building, the act of being seen carries immense risk in environments of digital entrapment, censorship, and social violence. The films themselves, along with distribution strategies like the secret screenings organized by ArabQ Films, are acutely aware of this tension, modeling a form of visibility that is tactical, ethical, and often deliberately circumscribed to protect its subjects and audiences.

### 8.2 Charting Future Scholarly Directions: Gaps, Intersections, and Deepening Analysis

While this study provides a broad overview, it also reveals significant gaps that chart essential directions for future scholarship. **A primary avenue is the dedicated analysis of transmasculine and non-binary narratives.** The primary corpus, influenced by availability and the dynamics of documentary access (as noted in *Be Like Others*, where female-to-male subjects were reluctant to participate), leaned toward transfeminine stories. Future research must actively seek out and analyze films centering trans men and non-binary individuals across the region to present a fuller picture of gender diversity.

**Second, intersectional analyses must deepen.** This paper has touched on intersections with class, migration, and race (particularly in diasporic films), but more work is needed on how transgender identity converges with disability, religious minority status (e.g., within Christian, Jewish, or heterodox Muslim communities in the MENA region), and different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. How do the experiences of a Kurdish trans woman in Iraq differ from those of an Arab trans woman in Lebanon or a Berber trans person in North Africa?

**Third, expanded reception studies are crucial.** Much current analysis, including this one, focuses on textual and production contexts. Future research should employ ethnographic and digital methods to understand how these films are actually viewed, discussed, and utilized within the MENA region—in underground screenings, online forums, and community spaces. How do local transgender and cisgender audiences interpret these narratives? What role do they play in community formation and political mobilization?

**Fourth, theoretical work must continue to develop frameworks that account for local gender epistemologies.** While Western transgender studies provides valuable tools, scholars must engage more deeply with Islamic jurisprudence, local philosophical traditions, and vernacular concepts of gender variance to avoid analytical imperialism. This involves a critical dialogue between transnational theory and region-specific knowledge.

**Finally, archival and historiographic research is needed to trace pre-1990s cinematic engagements with gender variance.** Unearthing earlier representations in popular cinema, television, and theatrical traditions would provide a richer historical context for the contemporary films discussed here, challenging the notion that transgender themes are a recent import or solely a product of globalized queer discourse.

### 8.3 The Evolving Cinematic Ecosystem: Production, Distribution, and Digital Frontiers

The future of MENA trans cinema will be fundamentally shaped by its evolving material conditions. **Production models are at a crossroads.** The rise of initiatives like ArabQ Films—the first Arab-based production company dedicated solely to queer narratives—signals a move toward institutional sustainability from within the region. Its mandate for queer authorship is a vital ethical innovation. However, the heavy reliance on Western co-production funding and festival validation persists, creating a potential tension between authentic storytelling and the demands of transnational appeal. The future likely holds a mixed economy: community-funded, low-budget digital works existing alongside internationally financed festival films.

**Distribution faces the dual forces of digital opportunity and digital peril.** Streaming platforms and online archives offer unprecedented potential to bypass state censorship and reach dispersed diasporic and regional audiences. However, the well-documented practices of digital entrapment by security forces, using social media and dating apps to target LGBTQ+ individuals, cast a long shadow. Filmmakers and curators will need to become increasingly sophisticated in digital security, employing encrypted communications, anonymous hosting, and closed-circuit streaming for high-risk contexts. The "speakeasy" screening model, with its strict safety protocols, may become more common rather than less.

**International film festivals will remain critical but contested gatekeepers.** They provide essential platforms for recognition, funding, and career launch. Yet, as Amrou Al-Kadhi's experience highlights, they can also reinforce narrow expectations about what constitutes a legitimate "queer Arab" story. The future health of the ecosystem depends on festivals cultivating programmers with deep regional knowledge and a commitment to formal and thematic diversity, moving beyond trauma-centric narratives to also celebrate innovation, genre play, and joy.

**Ultimately, the most resilient future may lie in hyper-local, community-embedded production.** Projects like *Treat Me Like Your Mother*, conceived as a collaborative "photographic scrapbook" for and by the trans community in Lebanon, model a cinema that prioritizes archival preservation, collective memory, and internal affirmation over external validation. Supporting such models requires rethinking funding streams to include micro-grants, community patronage, and regional arts funds willing to support politically sensitive work.

### 8.4 Cinema as Catalyst: Speculating on Socio-Political Impact and Trans Futures

Beyond the screen, MENA trans cinema holds profound, if complex, socio-political potential. **Its primary power is as a tool for community building and historical preservation.** In a context where official histories erase transgender lives, films become living archives. *Treat Me Like Your Mother* explicitly serves this function, documenting stories of friendship, resistance, and survival to create a legacy for future generations. This cinematic archive fosters a sense of continuity, identity, and shared struggle that is vital for community resilience in the face of persecution.

**Secondly, these films act as engines for empathy and discursive shift, particularly across social divides within their societies.** By humanizing transgender experiences and framing them within relatable contexts of family conflict, economic pressure, and the search for dignity—as seen in *Facing Mirrors* and *Joyland*—cinema can subtly challenge deep-seated prejudices. The reported screening of *Facing Mirrors* in a Qom seminary suggests that even within conservative spheres, these narratives can open spaces for dialogue that abstract political arguments cannot.

**However, it is crucial to temper optimism with realism.** Cinema alone cannot overturn draconian laws or instantly transform public opinion in highly polarized environments. Its impact is often gradual, working on the level of culture and affect. Furthermore, the backlash can be severe; increased visibility can sometimes provoke intensified repression, as seen in regressive legal proposals in Turkey or increased digital policing.

**Therefore, the most viable future is not a linear march toward Western-style liberal visibility, but a continued, nuanced, and tactical negotiation.** MENA trans cinema will likely persist in operating across a spectrum: from openly activist works circulating on global platforms to subtle, coded narratives intended for local consumption, and intimate community archives meant for internal sustenance. Its greatest socio-political contribution may be in **modeling a form of resistance that is adaptable, culturally rooted, and insistently creative**—using the tools of storytelling not just to demand rights from states, but to imagine and enact alternative ways of being, belonging, and loving within and beyond the constraints of the present. In doing so, it projects a future where transgender lives are not merely tolerated but are recognized as central to the rich, complex tapestry of Middle Eastern and North African societies and their global diasporas.
