# A Comparative Analysis of Manufacturing Technologies for Hollow Motor Shafts in New Energy Vehicle Electric Drive Units
## 1 Introduction: The Role and Requirements of Hollow Shafts in NEV Electrification

This chapter establishes the foundational context for the comparative analysis of manufacturing technologies by defining the critical role of hollow motor shafts within New Energy Vehicle (NEV) electric drive units. It systematically analyzes the specific performance demands placed on these shafts, synthesizing information from the reference materials to derive key design and material property requirements. The analysis focuses on four core application-driven requirements: high torque transmission and structural integrity under load, weight reduction for improved energy efficiency and extended driving range, effective thermal management to handle high power densities, and seamless integration with gearboxes for compact system design. This chapter synthesizes benchmark criteria from these needs, setting the stage for evaluating how different manufacturing technologies meet these stringent demands. It leverages data from market reports, engineering analyses of hollow shaft advantages, studies on EV motor trends, and performance comparisons to define the problem space and establish the evaluation framework for subsequent technological comparisons.

### 1.1 Critical Function of Hollow Shafts in NEV Electric Drive Units

The hollow motor shaft is a pivotal component within the modern integrated electric drive unit of a New Energy Vehicle (NEV). Its primary function is to transmit rotational power (torque) from the electric motor's rotor to the drivetrain, ultimately propelling the vehicle[^1]. Unlike a solid shaft, its defining characteristic is a central bore, which allows for direct mounting onto the driven equipment's shaft, bypassing the need for couplings or other alignment systems[^2][^3]. This design embodies the principle of direct drive engineering, leading to more efficient torque transmission, reduced mechanical loss, and a more compact system[^2].

The shift from solid to hollow shaft designs is a direct response to the transformative trends in NEV electrification. The global market for NEV motor shafts is substantial and growing rapidly, projected to reach USD 3,780 million by 2033[^4]. A key trend within this growth is the **increasing adoption of hollow shafts**, which are gaining traction due to their superior strength-to-weight ratio—a property crucial for optimizing vehicle range and performance[^4]. This trend aligns with the broader industry movement towards highly integrated, compact electric drive units that combine the motor, power electronics, and gearbox into a single module to reduce interfaces, weight, and assembly work[^5][^6]. Within these integrated systems, the hollow shaft serves not only as a torque conduit but also as an enabler for space-saving designs and advanced functionalities like integrated cooling.

### 1.2 Performance Demand I: High Torque Transmission and Structural Integrity

NEV drive motors are characterized by high torque output and operational speeds, placing exceptional mechanical demands on the rotor shaft[^4]. The shaft must possess high **torsional strength** to resist twisting forces and **structural integrity** to maintain its form under load, preventing catastrophic failure.

The fundamental requirement for torque transmission is rooted in the shaft's role as a rotating machine element that transmits power from the engine (or motor) to other components[^1]. To handle the increased demands of NEVs, the shaft must be designed to sustain high torque and rotational forces[^1]. This involves careful consideration of **torsional stiffness** to avoid excessive twisting and **fatigue resistance**, as fatigue is a leading cause of engineering failures in rotating components[^7]. Design features such as splines or keyways are often incorporated to lock components and prevent slippage, ensuring firm connections[^1].

A comparative study of solid and hollow shafts made from AISI 1045 steel provides concrete performance insights. While **solid shafts exhibit higher torsional stiffness and a higher maximum torque before yielding**, hollow shafts demonstrate a more favorable **strength-to-mass ratio**, showing an increase of up to 18.7% compared to solid shafts in torsional tests[^8]. This indicates that for a given weight, a well-designed hollow shaft can be more efficient. Therefore, the performance demand is not merely for maximum strength, but for an optimal balance of strength, stiffness, and mass efficiency, ensuring the shaft can handle peak loads and high-cycle fatigue over the vehicle's lifespan[^7].

### 1.3 Performance Demand II: Weight Reduction for Efficiency and Range Extension

**Weight reduction is arguably the primary driver for adopting hollow shafts in NEV applications.** Reducing the mass of rotating components, particularly the rotor, has a direct and significant impact on vehicle performance. A heavier rotor increases the mass inertia, which limits acceleration capabilities and consumes more energy, thereby reducing overall EV efficiency and driving range[^9].

The market imperative is clear: there is a growing demand for lightweight solutions in vehicle design to improve energy efficiency and extend driving range[^10][^4]. Hollow shafts directly address this by removing material from the core, offering a compelling advantage over solid shafts. Research and development efforts target **significant weight reductions**, with trial productions of hollow motor shafts for railway applications demonstrating **over 30% mass reduction**[^11]. In automotive contexts, innovative hybrid shafts combining carbon-reinforced plastic (CFRP) with steel aim for up to **50% weight reduction** compared to conventional solid steel shafts[^9].

This demand translates into a critical material property requirement: a high **strength-to-weight ratio**. Hollow shafts inherently provide this benefit, as they contribute to reducing drivetrain weight without necessarily sacrificing the torque or power transmission capability[^2][^10]. The pursuit of lightweighting also drives material science innovation, leading to the use of advanced high-strength steels (AHSS), alloys, and composites that allow for thinner-walled, lighter shafts while maintaining necessary strength[^4].

### 1.4 Performance Demand III: Thermal Management for High Power Density Operation

Modern NEV motors operate at very high power densities, generating substantial heat. Effective **thermal management** is therefore a critical performance demand. Excessive heat is a common cause of motor failure, leading to reduced efficiency, premature wear, and degradation of components like magnets and insulation[^12][^13].

The compact, high-power design of motors, including in-wheel configurations, presents significant thermal management challenges[^12]. Traditional cooling methods like air cooling or cooling jackets may be insufficient. This is where the hollow shaft design offers a transformative advantage: it enables **integrated direct cooling**. **Hollow shaft cooling** is an innovative approach where a coolant (oil, water, or air) is channeled through the hollow passage inside the shaft[^13]. This provides direct cooling to the rotor—the hottest region often difficult to reach with external methods—absorbing heat and carrying it away via a circulation system[^13]. Studies indicate this method can reduce internal motor temperatures by up to 40% compared to traditional cooling[^13]. In EV traction motors, optimized hollow shaft cooling has been shown to improve temperature stability by 25% and extend operational range[^13].

This performance demand creates specific design requirements for the shaft. It must be feasible to incorporate **internal cooling channels, fins, or cavities** to facilitate coolant flow[^14]. Furthermore, the manufacturing process and materials must be compatible with cooling systems, considering factors like fluid compatibility and sealing[^15][^5]. The trend towards "all-in-one" integrated electric drive systems further leverages this by allowing the gearbox lubricating oil to also serve as the motor's cooling oil, sharing a common thermal management system[^15].

### 1.5 Performance Demand IV: Integration with Gearboxes and System Compactness

NEV electric drive units prioritize compactness and integration. The hollow motor shaft must seamlessly interface with reduction gearboxes in a space-efficient manner. **Hollow shaft gearboxes** are specifically designed with a central cavity that allows the motor shaft (or another shaft) to pass through[^16]. This enables direct mounting, eliminating the need for additional couplings, adapters, and the space they occupy, which speeds up installation and reduces potential misalignment issues[^2][^16].

This integration demand places a premium on **dimensional accuracy, low backlash, and high torsional rigidity**. For instance, precision planetary gearheads with hollow shafts specify backlash of less than **3 arc-min** and integrate cross roller bearings to provide high moment stiffness and precise positioning accuracy[^17]. Some advanced gear units achieve lifelong **zero backlash** and maintenance-free operation, which is crucial for high-precision applications and contributes to system efficiency and low vibration[^18].

The requirement for compactness is a key trend in drive unit design, as seen in various OEM implementations where the inverter is radially or axially mounted on a highly integrated motor-gearbox assembly[^5]. The hollow shaft is central to this architecture, enabling a more compact and robust connection between the motor rotor and the gear input, which is essential for achieving high power density and reducing the overall size and weight of the drive unit[^6].

### 1.6 Synthesis of Key Design and Material Property Requirements

The analysis of the four core performance demands culminates in a consolidated set of benchmark criteria. These criteria define the multifaceted problem that manufacturing technologies for hollow NEV motor shafts must solve:

1.  **Mechanical Performance:** The technology must produce shafts capable of ensuring **high torsional strength, fatigue resistance, and sufficient stiffness** to handle NEV-specific torque and speed profiles, while optimizing the strength-to-weight ratio[^7][^8].
2.  **Mass Efficiency:** The process must enable **significant weight reduction**, typically targeting over 30%, by producing thin-walled or complex hollow structures that minimize material use without compromising structural integrity[^9][^11].
3.  **Thermal Management Integration:** The manufacturing route must allow for the **integration of internal features** such as cooling channels, fins, or smooth bores to facilitate direct coolant flow for effective rotor thermal management[^13][^14][^11].
4.  **Geometric and Dimensional Precision:** The technology must achieve **high dimensional accuracy, fine surface quality, and material integrity** to ensure reliable integration with gearboxes (e.g., via splines), minimize imbalance, and enable low-vibration, high-efficiency operation[^16][^17][^14].
5.  **Material Compatibility and Advancement:** The process must be compatible with and effectively utilize **advanced materials** such as high-strength steel alloys (e.g., 42CrMo, SCr420), chromoly steel, aluminum, titanium, and composite materials (e.g., CFRP) to meet the combined demands of strength, weight, and sometimes corrosion resistance[^10][^4][^11][^19].

These synthesized requirements establish a rigorous framework for evaluating the suitability, trade-offs, and ultimate selection of manufacturing technologies for hollow motor shafts in the demanding context of New Energy Vehicle electrification.

## 2 Landscape of Current Hollow Shaft Forming and Manufacturing Techniques

This chapter provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the primary manufacturing technologies currently employed and emerging for the production of hollow shafts, with a specific focus on their applicability to New Energy Vehicle (NEV) motor shafts. Building upon the performance requirements established in Chapter 1, this analysis systematically evaluates each technology's process mechanics, material compatibility, achievable geometric and mechanical properties, and inherent trade-offs. The chapter structurally absorbs detailed information from the reference materials to define and compare key processes, including Seamless Tubing, Welded Tubing, Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) tubing, advanced machining, and composite fabrication methods. It also explores innovative hybrid approaches. The analysis highlights comparative dimensions such as strength-to-weight ratio, dimensional precision, integration of cooling features, cost implications, and scalability, directly linking process capabilities to NEV application demands. This chapter serves as the foundational technology inventory and preliminary evaluation necessary for the subsequent comparative assessment and selection framework.

### 2.1 Metal Tubing Forming Processes: From Billet to Precision Tube

This section analyzes traditional and refined metal forming processes that produce the tubular blanks or near-net-shape shafts. The landscape is dominated by three primary categories: seamless tubing, welded tubing, and the refined Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) process, each with distinct process mechanics and outcome profiles.

**Seamless Tubing** is manufactured from a solid steel billet, creating a tube without a welded seam. The primary methods are hot rolling and cold drawing[^20]. The hot rolling process involves heating a billet above 1200°C and piercing its center with a mandrel to create a hollow shell, which is then elongated and sized. This method is suitable for large diameters but results in a rougher surface finish, lower strength, and less precise dimensional tolerances[^20]. In contrast, the **cold drawing process** shapes a pre-formed hollow tube at room temperature by pulling it through a die and over a mandrel. This cold work induces work hardening, significantly increasing the material's strength—typically by 2-3 times that of the base material[^21][^20]. Cold Drawn Seamless (CDS) tubing offers excellent surface finish and precise tolerances but is prone to eccentricity (wall thickness variation) due to the challenges of precise control in the piercing and drawing process[^22]. Seamless tubing is considered 100% homogeneous with no weld zone, making it the standard for critical high-pressure applications, though it commands a higher price due to its energy-intensive manufacturing[^23][^22].

**Welded Tubing**, specifically Electric Resistance Welded (ERW) tubing, begins with a steel strip formed into a tube shape, with the edges joined using heat and pressure from a high-frequency electrical current[^24]. It is a cost-effective process but leaves an internal weld flash, and the weld seam can be a potential weak point[^23]. ERW tubing is commonly made from SAE 1010 steel and serves as a precursor for more refined processes[^23].

The **Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) process** represents a significant refinement of welded tubing. It starts with an ERW tube, from which the entire weld flash is removed. The tube is then cold drawn through a die and over a mandrel[^25][^24][^23]. This cold-working process is critical: it not only sizes the tube to precise dimensions but also cold-works the steel, increasing its tensile strength and yield strength[^22]. More importantly, it aligns the grain structure of the weld with the parent material, making the seam virtually undetectable and enhancing its strength[^24][^22]. **DOM tubing is renowned for its superior concentricity, incredibly uniform wall thickness, and a smooth, mirror-like finish due to the burnishing effect of the mandrel**[^22]. It is typically made from higher-grade steels like SAE 1020 or 1026[^23].

The following table summarizes the key comparative aspects of these metal tubing processes:

| **Aspect** | **Seamless (Hot Rolled)** | **Seamless (Cold Drawn - CDS)** | **ERW Welded** | **DOM** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key Process** | Hot piercing & rolling of billet (>1200°C) | Cold drawing of pre-formed tube at room temperature | Electric resistance welding of formed strip | Cold drawing of ERW tube over a mandrel |
| **Structural Homogeneity** | 100% homogeneous, no weld | 100% homogeneous, no weld | Contains a weld seam | Contains a cold-worked, refined weld seam |
| **Strength** | Lower strength | **High strength** due to work hardening | Base material strength | **High strength** due to cold working; weld strength enhanced |
| **Dimensional Accuracy** | Lower precision, prone to eccentricity | Good precision, but eccentricity possible | Moderate precision | **Superior concentricity & uniform wall thickness**[^22] |
| **Surface Finish** | Rough, mill-scale finish | Excellent, smooth finish | Moderate, with internal weld flash | **Very smooth, mirror-like finish**[^22] |
| **Cost** | Lower cost than CDS | Higher cost due to process intensity | **Most cost-effective** | More economical than seamless for standard sizes[^22] |
| **Primary NEV Relevance** | Less common for precision shafts | High-performance applications requiring homogeneity | Precursor for DOM; cost-sensitive applications | **Preferred for structural components like drive shafts, steering columns**[^22] due to strength-to-weight ratio and precise fitment. |

For automotive components like drive shafts, **DOM tubing is often favored over seamless tubing for mechanical structural applications**. While seamless tubing generally has higher allowable working pressures per ASME codes (which derate welded materials), the cold-working in DOM increases its yield strength. In applications where pressure codes are not the primary driver, DOM can be stronger and stiffer than hot-rolled seamless tubing, while offering better dimensional accuracy at a lower cost[^22].

### 2.2 Material Removal and Precision Machining Techniques

While forming processes create the tubular geometry, **advanced CNC machining** plays a critical role in hollow shaft manufacturing, either for creating shafts from solid stock or, more commonly, for adding precision features to pre-formed tubes. This subtractive process is defined by high flexibility and exceptional accuracy.

The process flow for custom shaft manufacturing is methodical: it begins with **design and programming** using CAD software to define geometry, followed by CAM software to generate toolpaths for CNC machines[^26][^27]. **Material selection** is crucial, with common choices including various grades of steel, aluminum, and titanium, chosen for their strength, weight, and machinability[^27]. The **machine setup** involves selecting appropriate CNC equipment (lathes, milling centers), cutting tools, and workholding fixtures[^26].

Key machining operations for hollow shafts include:
*   **CNC Turning:** Ideal for cylindrical parts, it rotates the workpiece while a cutting tool removes material to achieve precise diameters, tapers, and external contours[^27].
*   **CNC Milling:** Used to create complex non-rotationally symmetric features such as keyways, splines, flanges, and mounting holes[^27].
*   **CNC Drilling:** Creates axial or radial holes for lubrication, weight reduction, or mounting[^27].
*   **Grinding & Thread Rolling:** Used for achieving ultra-fine surface finishes, tight tolerances, and strong threads, respectively[^27].

The **unique value proposition of machining lies in its ability to create highly complex and precise internal geometries**. This is particularly relevant for NEV motor shafts that require integrated thermal management. For instance, machining is capable of producing the intricate **internal ducting, fins, and controlled flow channels** described in advanced thermal design studies for hollow shafts[^28], features that are extremely difficult or impossible to achieve through standard tubing forming processes alone. Furthermore, machining is essential for creating high-precision coupling features like splines or gear teeth with minimal backlash, ensuring reliable integration with gearboxes[^26].

However, this capability comes with trade-offs. Machining from solid stock generates significant material waste, increasing cost and reducing material efficiency. It is also generally slower than forming processes for high-volume production. **Therefore, its primary suitability is for prototyping, low-to-medium volume production, and as a secondary finishing process to add precision features to near-net-shape formed tubes (e.g., machining splines onto a DOM tube blank)**. For high-volume NEV applications, machining is typically integrated into a hybrid manufacturing route rather than serving as the primary shaping method.

### 2.3 Composite Material Fabrication: Filament Winding and Pultrusion

Composite materials, particularly Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), are forecast for rapid adoption in automotive drive shafts due to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio[^29]. Two primary continuous manufacturing processes are used to create composite hollow shafts: Filament Winding and Pultrusion.

**Filament Winding** is a sophisticated process for creating hollow composite structures of incredible strength[^30]. Continuous fibers (rovings) of carbon, glass, or aramid are impregnated with resin and wound onto a rotating mandrel in a precise pattern controlled by a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) system[^30][^31]. The **Engineered Layup Pattern (ELP)** is critical; by varying the winding angle, engineers can tailor mechanical properties—a low angle provides greater tensile strength, while a higher angle enhances circumferential (hoop) strength[^30]. After winding, the assembly is cured in an oven, and the mandrel is removed, leaving a hollow composite part[^30]. The process is highly automated, ensuring consistent quality, and allows for precise fiber placement to optimize performance[^31]. A key performance advantage for automotive applications is that **CFRP shafts have been shown to possess five to ten times the torsional damping of steel shafts**, which can improve Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) characteristics[^32]. The process is well-suited for closed-end structures like pressure vessels and drive shafts[^31].

**Pultrusion** is a continuous process for manufacturing composite profiles with a constant cross-section[^33]. Continuous fibers are pulled from creels, impregnated with resin, shaped in a preformer, and then cured in a heated die to form a solid profile[^33][^34]. For hollow sections like shafts, a **mandrel is used within the die**[^33]. Pultrusion is one of the most cost-effective processes for high-volume composite parts[^35]. However, a **significant limitation is that it is primarily suited for producing straight, constant cross-section profiles**; manufacturing tapered or complex shapes is challenging[^33]. Advanced systems like Radius-Pultrusion are emerging to create curved profiles, but the technology is primarily geared towards linear components[^35].

**The table below contrasts these two primary composite manufacturing routes:**

| **Aspect** | **Filament Winding** | **Pultrusion** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process Nature** | Fibers wound onto a rotating mandrel. | Fibers pulled linearly through a stationary die. |
| **Fiber Orientation** | **Highly tailorable** (helical, hoop, polar). Engineered for multidirectional strength. | Predominantly axial (0°), with some capability for off-axis layers via mats or fabrics. |
| **Part Geometry** | Suited for cylindrical, spherical, or axisymmetric closed-end structures (e.g., tubes, tanks). | **Constant cross-section**, straight profiles. Limited complexity. |
| **Production Volume** | Suitable for medium to high volume, highly automated. | **Excellent for very high-volume, continuous production.** |
| **Key Strength** | Tailored mechanical properties, high strength-to-weight, ability to make closed structures. | **Lowest cost per unit for high-volume linear profiles**, fast production rates. |
| **Primary NEV Relevance** | **High-performance drive shafts**, output shafts, where tailored stiffness and damping are needed[^31][^32]. | Structural beams, chassis components. Less direct for complex rotating shafts unless profile is simple. |

The market context is critical: **carbon-fiber/CFRP shafts are projected to grow at a 14.33% CAGR** in the automotive drive shaft market, driven by weight reduction mandates and NVH improvements[^29]. Manufacturing scale improvements are reducing carbon-fiber shaft costs by approximately 15-20% annually, enhancing economic viability[^29]. However, the market faces a restraint from **raw material price volatility**, with carbon fiber prices fluctuating 25-30% quarterly due to supply chain bottlenecks[^29].

### 2.4 Innovative Hybrid and Advanced Forming Approaches

To overcome the limitations of single-material or single-process routes, several innovative hybrid and advanced forming approaches are being developed, directly targeting the multifaceted requirements of NEV motor shafts.

**Two-Piece Flowformed and Welded Design:** NETFORM has developed an advanced hollow rotor shaft comprising two flowformed half-shafts that are laser-welded together[^21]. The **flowforming process** itself is key: it involves spinning a metal preform while rollers deform it, inducing severe work hardening. This increases material strength by **2-3 times that of the base material**, allowing for a reduction in wall thickness and overall weight[^21]. This design explicitly addresses thermal management by allowing coolant oil flow through the hollow shaft. An optional center support with inserts can be added to increase stiffness and prevent coolant pooling, showcasing a design-for-manufacturing approach that integrates multiple functions[^21].

**Hybrid Metal-Composite Co-Curing:** A novel manufacturing method involves co-curing a carbon fiber epoxy composite layer on the **inner surface** of an aluminum tube, rather than the exterior[^36]. This protects the composite from external impact and moisture. The process involves stacking composite layers on a mandrel, inserting it into the aluminum tube, applying pressure, and curing in an autoclave. The steel yokes are joined via a press-fit method with protrusions that engrave grooves into the aluminum for mechanical interlocking[^36]. The result is a **hybrid shaft with a 75% mass reduction and a 160% increase in torque capability** compared to a conventional two-piece steel drive shaft, demonstrating the dramatic performance gains possible through material and process hybridization[^36].

**Design-Driven Manufacturing for Thermal Management:** Research into thermal design for EV induction motor shafts illustrates how advanced manufacturing enables functional integration. Studies of hollow shafts with internal **duct designs and extended fins** show a 303% increase in heat transfer coefficient compared to simple counterflow designs[^28]. Creating such complex internal geometries—where fins meet at the center to divide the shaft into multiple fluid channels—requires sophisticated manufacturing capabilities, likely combining advanced tube forming, internal machining, or potentially metal additive manufacturing, pointing to future manufacturing trends[^28].

### 2.5 Preliminary Technology Assessment Against NEV Shaft Requirements

This section provides an initial, high-level mapping of the capabilities of the analyzed manufacturing techniques onto the key design and material property requirements for NEV hollow motor shafts synthesized in Chapter 1.6. The following assessment, summarized in the table below, highlights the inherent strengths and trade-offs of each technology family.

| **Evaluation Criteria** | **DOM Tubing** | **Seamless Tubing (CDS)** | **Precision Machining** | **Filament Winding (CFRP)** | **Hybrid (e.g., Metal/Composite)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanical Performance** | **High strength** from cold work; good stiffness. Excellent fatigue resistance in weld. | **High homogeneous strength**; good stiffness. No weld seam concern. | Strength depends on base material. Can achieve highest precision features. | **Exceptional strength-to-weight**; tailorable stiffness; **high torsional damping**[^32]. | Can combine metal strength with composite lightweighting; performance highly tailored. |
| **Mass Efficiency** | Good (hollow, thin walls possible). | Good (hollow, thin walls possible). | Poor if from solid; good if finishing a pre-formed tube. | **Excellent** (up to 60% lighter than steel)[^29]. | **Excellent** (e.g., 75% mass reduction demonstrated)[^36]. |
| **Thermal Mgmt. Integration** | Smooth ID suitable for fluid flow; simple internal features possible via secondary ops. | Smooth ID; complex internal features difficult. | **Best capability** for complex internal channels, fins, ducts[^28]. | Limited; typically solid wall composite. Internal features very challenging. | Potential to integrate cooling in metal core, insulated by composite. |
| **Geometric Precision** | **Excellent concentricity & wall uniformity**[^22]; high-quality surface finish. | Good, but prone to eccentricity; good surface finish (CDS). | **Ultimate precision** for complex features, tolerances, and surface finish. | Good for cylindrical forms; precision depends on mandrel and process control. | Varies; depends on core process and assembly method. |
| **Material Compatibility** | High-strength low-alloy steels (e.g., 1026). | Wide range of steels and alloys. | **All machinable materials** (metals, some composites). | **Carbon, glass, aramid fibers** with thermoset/thermoplastic resins. | **Combines metals (Al, steel) with composites** for optimized properties. |
| **Cost & Scalability** | **Cost-effective for high volume**; excellent scalability[^22]. | Higher cost than DOM; good scalability. | High cost for volume; low scalability as primary process. | **High material cost**, volatile supply[^29]; scalability improving with automation. | High cost due to complexity; scalability currently low to medium. |

**Key Insights from the Preliminary Assessment:**
*   **DOM Tubing** presents a strong, balanced option for high-volume NEV shafts, offering an excellent combination of strength, precision, weight efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. It is a proven technology for automotive structural components.
*   **Seamless Tubing (CDS)** offers superior homogeneity for the most critical applications but at a higher cost and with potential dimensional trade-offs compared to DOM.
*   **Precision Machining** is unmatched for creating complex internal and external features but is not economically viable as the primary shaping method for high volumes. It is essential as a secondary process.
*   **Filament-Wound CFRP Shafts** deliver the highest performance in terms of specific strength and NVH damping, directly addressing range extension and refinement needs. However, they are currently constrained by **higher costs and raw material price volatility**[^29], making them more suitable for premium or performance-oriented NEV applications.
*   **Hybrid Approaches** offer groundbreaking potential to optimize multiple requirements simultaneously (e.g., weight, strength, heat management) but involve greater manufacturing complexity and are currently at a lower maturity level for mass production.

This landscape analysis reveals that there is no single "best" technology. The optimal choice depends on prioritizing specific requirements within the NEV performance-cost matrix. The following chapter will develop a more rigorous comparative framework to guide this selection.

## 3 Comparative Framework: Evaluation Criteria for Technology Assessment

This chapter establishes a rigorous, multi-dimensional evaluation framework to systematically compare the manufacturing technologies for hollow NEV motor shafts identified in Chapter 2. Building directly upon the synthesized performance requirements from Chapter 1.6, the framework defines five core evaluation criteria: Material Compatibility & Advanced Alloys, Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability, Geometric Capabilities & Precision Tolerances, Required Post-Processing & Integration Steps, and Resultant Mechanical & Dynamic Properties. Each criterion is broken down into specific, data-driven sub-factors informed by the reference materials, such as material-specific formability issues (e.g., 7075 aluminum's low room-temperature formability), cost components (e.g., raw material price volatility for carbon fiber), tolerance classes (e.g., h9 for cold-drawn vs. h7/g6 for ground), and the impact of processes like heat treatment on fatigue life. This structured framework enables a quantitative and qualitative assessment of each technology's suitability for meeting the stringent, multi-faceted demands of NEV applications, setting the stage for the final selection analysis.

### 3.1 Criterion I: Material Compatibility and Advanced Alloy Performance

This criterion evaluates the range of materials each manufacturing process can effectively utilize and the resulting mechanical performance. The suitability of a material is intrinsically linked to the forming mechanics of the process, which directly impacts the final shaft's strength, weight, and durability.

**High-Strength Alloy Steels for Forging and Forming:** Processes like forging, rotary swaging, and flowforming excel with medium-carbon and alloy steels, where plastic deformation enhances properties. Key materials include:
*   **4140/4150 Alloy Steel:** Widely used for shafts requiring high strength and toughness. In a heat-treated condition, it can achieve a typical tensile strength of 156,000 PSI (≈1075 MPa) and a hardness of Rockwell C 28/34[^37]. This makes it ideal for components subjected to high torsional and bending loads.
*   **42CrMo, 40Cr, 40MnB:** These are common Chinese designations for alloy steels used in heavily loaded automotive shafts. For instance, 40Cr offers an ultimate tensile strength of 1000 MPa after quenching[^38].
*   **30CrMnSiNi2A:** A high-strength steel studied for its torsional fatigue behavior, exhibiting cyclic softening and non-Masing behavior, which must be accounted for in life prediction models[^39].

**The cold working inherent in processes like flowforming and cold forging significantly increases material strength through work hardening, typically by 2-3 times that of the base material**[^21]. This allows for thinner wall designs without sacrificing performance.

**Challenges with Advanced Lightweight Alloys:** Material selection is not merely about ultimate strength; formability is a critical constraint.
*   **7075 Aluminum Alloy:** While offering a steel-like strength (ultimate tensile strength of 510–570 MPa in T6/T651 temper) with low density, it has **low formability at room temperature and is vulnerable to stress corrosion cracking**[^40][^41]. This makes traditional cold forming difficult. Successful manufacturing often requires **hot forming (300–400°C) or a strategy of pre-forming in the soft O temper followed by age hardening**[^40].
*   **Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP):** Compatibility is defined by the manufacturing process itself. Filament winding requires specific fiber types (e.g., T700S carbon) and resin systems (e.g., bismaleimide for high temperature)[^42]. The mechanical properties are highly dependent on design parameters such as **fiber volume fraction (Vf)** and **ply stacking sequence**. For a hollow shaft under torsion, an optimal layup is **[(+45°/-45°)s]n**, with ±45° plies providing buckling stability and carrying shear loads[^43]. A Vf of 0.7 can yield an ultimate strength of 480 MPa and a shear modulus of 82.5 GPa[^43].

**Material-Process Synergy for Hybrid Designs:** Innovative approaches combine materials to overcome individual limitations. For example, a hybrid shaft co-cures a CFRP layer on the **inner surface** of an aluminum tube, using the aluminum to sustain torque and the CFRP to increase bending natural frequency[^36][^44]. This demands compatible curing cycles and interface bonding techniques.

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
*   **Allowed Material Grades:** Can the process handle high-strength steels, aluminum alloys, titanium, or composites?
*   **Formability Constraints:** Does the material require hot working, special heat treatment during forming, or is it prone to cracking?
*   **Property Enhancement:** Does the process (e.g., cold work) improve yield/ultimate strength and fatigue resistance?
*   **Design Freedom for Composites:** Can the process control fiber orientation and volume fraction to tailor stiffness and strength?

### 3.2 Criterion II: Cost-Effectiveness and Production Scalability

This criterion deconstructs the total cost of ownership and scalability potential, which are decisive for high-volume automotive applications. Cost is a multi-faceted metric influenced by raw materials, capital investment, and production volume.

**Raw Material Cost and Volatility:** The base material cost is a fundamental driver, subject to significant market fluctuations.
*   **Steel Alloys:** For example, 4140 steel has a typical price range of $1.50 to $2.00 per kg[^45]. Costs are relatively stable compared to advanced materials.
*   **Carbon Fiber:** This is a major cost driver and restraint for composite shafts. **Carbon fiber prices can fluctuate 25-30% quarterly** due to aerospace demand cycles and energy costs, creating supply chain uncertainty and profit pressure[^29].
*   **Material Utilization Efficiency:** Processes that generate near-net-shape parts drastically reduce waste. **Extrusion achieves 90-98% material utilization**, and **cold forging can save over 70% of material compared to machining**[^46][^47]. Machining from solid stock, in contrast, can incur material losses up to 75%[^48].

**Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Tooling Costs:** The initial investment required for production equipment varies dramatically.
*   **High-Cost Processes:** Advanced manufacturing technologies for hollow shafts, such as precision forging lines, hydroforming, or automated composite winding cells, require **high initial investment**[^49]. A production-grade extrusion line can cost between **$150,000 and $2,000,000+**, with die tooling adding $2,000 to $50,000 per design[^46].
*   **Lower-Cost Entry:** **Machining (CNC) has lower upfront setup costs** but higher ongoing per-unit costs due to labor and material waste, making it suitable for prototypes and low volumes[^50][^51].

**Economies of Scale and Production Volume:** The most cost-effective technology depends heavily on the required annual output.
*   **High-Volume Champions:** **Cold forging, extrusion, and rotary swaging are highly cost-effective for mass production**. Once tooling is paid for, the per-unit cost drops significantly due to high speed and automation. Cold forging can deliver up to 450 pieces per minute[^47].
*   **Volume Thresholds:** For extrusion, the economic "sweet spot" typically lies between **50,000 to 500,000 units annually**[^46]. Below 5,000 units, machining is often more economical despite higher material waste.
*   **Labor and Automation Trade-offs:** Automation reduces long-term labor costs but increases CAPEX. An ROI analysis example shows that replacing manual labor with a robotic system can yield a **first-year ROI of $58,000 and a second-year ROI of $490,000** in a specific production scenario[^52]. The pressure to reduce costs in the competitive automotive market is driving OEMs to seek these efficiencies[^53].

**Scalability from Prototype to Mass Production:** A viable manufacturing route must efficiently scale to meet NEV production targets, which can reach millions of units annually[^54]. Processes like machining are difficult to scale cost-effectively, while stamped/welded or advanced formed metal solutions are inherently more scalable.

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
*   **Unit Cost vs. Volume Curve:** How does the cost per shaft change from 1,000 to 100,000 to 1,000,000 units?
*   **Break-even Volume:** At what production quantity does a high-CAPEX process become cheaper than a low-CAPEX one?
*   **Impact of Raw Material Price Swings:** How sensitive is the total cost to the volatility of materials like carbon fiber?
*   **Labor Content and Automation Potential:** What is the balance between skilled labor costs and the investment in automated equipment?

### 3.3 Criterion III: Geometric Capabilities and Precision Tolerances

This criterion assesses the ability to achieve the complex shapes, internal features, and exacting dimensional accuracies required for reliable integration and high-performance operation in an NEV drivetrain.

**Achievable Tolerances and Surface Finish:** Different processes yield distinct levels of precision, often categorized by standard tolerance classes.
*   **Cold-Drawn Tubing:** Typically holds an **h9 tolerance** with a surface roughness (Ra) of **6.3 µm**[^55]. This is suitable for many structural applications.
*   **Precision Ground/Machined Shafts:** Can achieve much tighter **h7 or g6 tolerances** with a smoother surface finish of **Ra 1.6 µm**[^55]. For critical fits, CNC machining can maintain tolerances as tight as **±0.005" (0.127 mm) or even ±0.002" (0.051 mm)** for high-precision features[^56][^57].
*   **Composite Shafts:** Dimensional accuracy is highly dependent on the mandrel and process control. While capable of good cylindrical form, achieving metal-grade tolerances on features like bearing seats often requires secondary machining.

**Capability for Internal and Complex Features:** This is crucial for integrated cooling and lightweight design.
*   **Internal Splines and Channels:** Specialized processes like **flowforming with internal splines** can create precision internal gear teeth in one operation[^58]. **Rotary compression** is another forming method investigated for producing hollow stepped gear shafts from tubes[^48].
*   **Complex Internal Geometries:** **CNC machining is unparalleled** for creating intricate internal cooling ducts, fins, and multi-channel designs that optimize heat transfer[^59]. Most forming processes are limited to relatively simple, axisymmetric internal bores.
*   **Near-Net-Shape Complexity:** **Cold forging and multi-stage forming** can produce shafts with external splines, flanges, and stepped diameters with minimal subsequent machining[^60][^61].

**Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T):** For shafts, controlling form and orientation is as important as size.
*   **Critical Controls:** **Cylindricity** ensures the shaft is both round and straight along its length, minimizing imbalance for high-speed operation[^62]. **Circular Runout** and **Total Runout** control surface variation as the shaft rotates, critical for smooth operation and bearing life[^62]. **Concentricity** (still in ISO standards) ensures the mass centerline aligns for rotational balance[^62].
*   **Manufacturing Implications:** Achieving tight GD&T controls often dictates the choice of process (e.g., grinding for cylindricity) and adds cost.

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
*   **Standard Dimensional Tolerance:** What ISO tolerance grade (e.g., h9, h7) is typically achievable?
*   **Surface Roughness (Ra):** What is the typical as-produced surface finish?
*   **Internal Feature Fabrication:** Can the process create splines, gears, or complex cooling channels internally?
*   **GD&T Compliance:** How well can the process control straightness, cylindricity, concentricity, and runout?

### 3.4 Criterion IV: Required Post-Processing and System Integration Steps

This criterion maps the ancillary processes required to transform a manufactured blank into a fully functional, integrated motor shaft. The number and complexity of these steps directly impact lead time, cost, and potential quality risks.

**Heat Treatment for Enhanced Properties:** This is often a mandatory step to achieve the required strength and durability.
*   **Objectives:** Heat treatment aims to **enhance mechanical properties (hardness, strength, toughness), eliminate residual stresses, and improve wear resistance**[^63].
*   **Common Processes:** For alloy steel shafts, **quenching and tempering** is standard to achieve a tempered martensite structure with good overall properties[^38][^64]. **Case hardening (e.g., carburizing) or nitriding** can be used to create a hard, wear-resistant surface while maintaining a tough core[^63][^64].
*   **Challenges with Hollow Shafts:** The thin-walled, hollow structure is **prone to distortion during heat treatment** due to uneven heat conduction and cooling[^65]. Mitigation strategies include using vacuum furnaces for precise temperature control, employing fixtures, and **leaving a large finishing allowance for post-heat-treatment grinding** to correct geometry[^65].

**Secondary Machining for Precision Features:** Even near-net-shape processes often require finishing operations.
*   **Typical Operations:** These include **grinding bearing journals** to achieve fine tolerances and surface finish, **milling keyways or splines** (if not formed), and **turning critical diameters**[^66][^67].
*   **Impact on Cost and Time:** Each secondary operation adds cost, requires additional fixturing, and extends the production cycle. A cost analysis for gear shafts showed that changing from "all-cutting + rolling" to "cold forging + rolling" reduced costs by approximately **20%** by minimizing machining[^60].

**Joining and Assembly Operations:** Many shaft designs are not monolithic.
*   **Welding:** Processes like **laser welding** are used to join two flowformed half-shafts[^21] or to attach yokes. **Friction Stir Welding (FSW)**, a solid-state process, is suitable for joining aluminium components and offers benefits like reduced distortion and high joint strength[^68].
*   **Press-Fitting and Adhesion:** Hybrid shafts often use **press-fitting with protrusions** or adhesive bonding to join composite tubes to metal end fittings[^36][^43].

**Surface Treatment and Finishing:**
*   **Coatings:** Treatments such as **black oxide, electroless nickel plating, or chrome plating** are applied for corrosion resistance, wear resistance, or aesthetic purposes[^55][^67].
*   **Balancing:** Dynamic balancing is a critical post-processing step for high-speed shafts to minimize vibration. The initial concentricity and uniformity provided by the primary manufacturing process directly influence the time and cost required for balancing.

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
*   **Heat Treatment Necessity & Complexity:** Is it required, and how challenging is it to control distortion?
*   **Extent of Secondary Machining:** What percentage of the final geometry requires machining after the primary forming?
*   **Number of Joining Steps:** Does the shaft require welding, bonding, or mechanical assembly?
*   **Post-Processing Flow Length:** How many sequential operations are needed to produce a ready-to-install shaft?

### 3.5 Criterion V: Resultant Mechanical and Dynamic Properties

This criterion analyzes the final performance characteristics of the shaft, providing the ultimate validation of a manufacturing technology's suitability. These properties are the direct outcome of the material selection and process mechanics.

**Torsional Strength and Stiffness:** The fundamental requirement for power transmission.
*   **Hollow vs. Solid Mechanics:** The torque-carrying capacity of a shaft is governed by the material near its outer radius. A well-designed hollow shaft can retain **over 90% of the torsional strength of a solid shaft of the same outer diameter and material, while using significantly less material**[^69]. The polar moment of inertia (J) for a hollow shaft is given by \( J = \frac{\pi}{32} \left[ (d_o)^4 - (d_i)^4 \right] \), which directly determines its torsional stiffness[^70].
*   **Process Enhancement:** **Flowforming and cold forging** induce work hardening, increasing yield strength and, consequently, the shaft's allowable torque[^21][^47].

**Fatigue Life and Durability:** Critical for long-term reliability under cyclic loading.
*   **Material Behavior:** Steels like 30CrMnSiNi2A exhibit complex **non-Masing behavior**, where fatigue damage correlates with the evolution of meso-deformation inhomogeneity under cyclic shear strain[^39]. Accurate life prediction requires sophisticated models that account for this.
*   **Process Influence:** **Forging and forming processes refine the grain structure**, leading to improved fatigue resistance compared to cast or machined parts[^50]. However, processes that leave **machining marks or sharp transitions** can create stress concentrations that drastically reduce fatigue life, as seen in failure analyses of half-shafts[^71].

**Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** The synthesized metric that drives range and efficiency.
*   **Quantitative Comparisons:** Advanced manufacturing enables dramatic improvements. A **hybrid aluminum/composite drive shaft** achieved a **75% mass reduction** and a **160% increase in torque capability** compared to a conventional steel shaft[^36]. The **"Hybrid Shaft Approach"** combining CFRP and steel targets a **~50% mass reduction**[^9]. **Rotary swaging** of a railway motor shaft achieved **over 30% weight reduction**[^11].
*   **Specific Stiffness:** A composite shaft with a ±45° layup can have a **specific stiffness (E/ρ) significantly higher than steel or aluminum**, optimizing performance per unit mass[^43].

**Dynamic Characteristics:**
*   **Natural Frequency:** The bending natural frequency must be sufficiently high to avoid resonance with operating speeds. **Hybrid metal-composite shafts** are explicitly designed to increase this frequency, allowing for one-piece designs in passenger cars[^44]. Modal analysis shows material choice (e.g., Aluminum 7075 vs. Steel SM45C) directly impacts natural frequencies across different modes[^72].
*   **Torsional Damping:** **CFRP shafts exhibit superior torsional damping**—**five to ten times that of steel shafts**—which can significantly improve NVH characteristics[^43].

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
*   **Ultimate Tensile/Yield Strength:** What are the achievable material properties post-manufacturing?
*   **Fatigue Strength (Endurance Limit):** What is the predicted or tested life under cyclic loading?
*   **Specific Strength (Strength/Density) & Specific Stiffness (Modulus/Density):** How efficient is the shaft in terms of performance per unit weight?
*   **Critical Speed/Natural Frequency:** Does the shaft design avoid resonant conditions within the operating range?

## 4 In-Depth Analysis and Comparison of Manufacturing Routes

This chapter conducts a rigorous, data-driven comparative assessment of the primary manufacturing technologies for hollow NEV motor shafts. Synthesizing the performance requirements from Chapter 1 and the technology landscape from Chapter 2, it employs the five-criteria evaluation framework established in Chapter 3 to systematically analyze and compare traditional metal-forming routes against advanced and composite routes. The analysis focuses on verifying specific performance claims, critically evaluating trade-offs between mechanical properties, mass efficiency, geometric capabilities, and post-processing needs, and extending the comparison to assess the implications of each technology on production scalability, cost structures, supply chain complexity, and alignment with the high-volume, cost-sensitive NEV manufacturing environment. This chapter provides the foundational analysis for the final technology selection and strategic recommendations.

### 4.1 Comparative Assessment of Traditional Metal-Forming Routes

This section performs a head-to-head comparison of Seamless (Hot Rolled and Cold Drawn), Welded (ERW), and Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) tubing processes against the five evaluation criteria, leveraging reference materials to anchor specific data points and quantify trade-offs.

**Material Compatibility & Advanced Alloy Performance:** All three metal-forming routes are compatible with a range of steels. Seamless processes, particularly cold drawing (CDS), are well-suited for high-strength alloy steels (e.g., 42CrMo) where work hardening can significantly increase yield strength[^11][^73]. DOM tubing, starting from ERW blanks made of steels like SAE 1020 or 1026, also benefits from cold work, enhancing the strength of both the base material and the refined weld seam. ERW is the most cost-effective but is typically limited to more common, lower-alloy grades. **The cold working inherent in CDS and DOM processes is a key performance enhancer, increasing material strength and fatigue resistance.**

**Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability:** ERW tubing is the most cost-effective entry point, with DOM offering a superior balance of performance and cost for high-volume production. The rotary swaging machine market, a key technology for further forming these tubes, is projected to grow from USD 4.8 billion in 2026 to USD 7.2 billion by 2036, with the automotive sector accounting for a 60% share, indicating strong alignment with NEV production volumes[^74][^75]. Demand is largely replacement-led, with manufacturers upgrading to CNC-controlled, energy-efficient, and automation-ready platforms[^74]. However, **high upfront investment for advanced systems and specialized tooling costs can restrain adoption among lower-volume producers**[^74][^76]. Seamless tubing, especially CDS, commands a higher price due to its more energy-intensive manufacturing process.

**Geometric Capabilities & Precision Tolerances:** **DOM tubing is distinguished by its superior concentricity and incredibly uniform wall thickness**, a result of the cold drawing over a mandrel which also provides a very smooth, mirror-like finish[^11][^73]. This makes it ideal for applications requiring precise fitment and balance. Cold Drawn Seamless (CDS) tubing offers excellent surface finish and good precision but can be prone to eccentricity (wall thickness variation). Hot-rolled seamless and basic ERW tubing have lower dimensional accuracy and rougher surfaces. For forming complex shapes like stepped diameters or external features, secondary processes like rotary swaging or flowforming are often applied to these tubular blanks.

**Required Post-Processing & Integration Steps:** Tubing products are typically near-net-shape blanks requiring significant secondary processing to become a functional motor shaft. **Mandatory steps include precision machining for bearing journals, splines, and mounting features, followed by dynamic balancing.** Heat treatment (quenching and tempering) is often required to achieve final mechanical properties; for instance, it increased the yield strength in a rotary-swaged region by 27.5% compared to the undeformed base material[^11][^73]. However, heat treating thin-walled hollow shafts carries a high risk of distortion, necessitating careful process control and potential post-heat-treatment grinding.

**Resultant Mechanical & Dynamic Properties:** The mechanical outcome is a strong, stiff shaft with good fatigue life, particularly for DOM and CDS due to cold work. A hollow design inherently offers weight savings and a lower moment of inertia, improving motor startup and stop response[^11][^73]. However, compared to a solid shaft of the same outer diameter, a hollow shaft will have **slightly reduced bending stiffness and torsional strength, though it offers a better strength-to-mass ratio**[^49][^50]. These traditional metal routes produce reliable, predictable components but may not achieve the extreme lightweighting targets of more advanced materials.

**Suitability for High-Volume NEV Production:** **DOM tubing presents a strong, balanced option for high-volume NEV shafts, offering an excellent combination of strength, precision, weight efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.** It is a proven, scalable technology for automotive structural components. Seamless CDS offers superior homogeneity for the most critical applications but at a higher cost. ERW serves as a cost-effective precursor for DOM or for less demanding applications. The overarching trend is towards **automation-ready, precision cold-forming processes like advanced swaging to support the automotive industry's lightweighting and high-performance design goals**[^74][^75].

### 4.2 Evaluation of Advanced and Composite Manufacturing Routes

This section analyzes the capabilities and limitations of Precision Machining, Filament Wound CFRP, and innovative Hybrid approaches, verifying performance claims and examining cost and scalability constraints.

**Material Compatibility & Advanced Alloy Performance:**
*   **Precision Machining:** Offers the widest material compatibility, handling all machinable metals (e.g., high-strength steels, aluminum, titanium) and some composites. Properties are defined by the base material stock.
*   **Filament Wound CFRP:** The process is defined by the material. Using high-strength carbon fibers (e.g., T700S) and epoxy resins, it achieves an **exceptional strength-to-weight ratio**. Mechanical properties are highly tailorable through fiber orientation and volume fraction.
*   **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine materials to overcome individual limitations. For example, co-curing CFRP on the inner surface of an aluminum tube leverages aluminum for torque transmission and CFRP to increase bending natural frequency and reduce mass[^77]. Another approach uses flowformed high-strength steel halves welded together, with the flowforming process itself increasing material strength by 2-3 times[^78].

**Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability:**
*   **Precision Machining:** Characterized by **low upfront tooling costs but high per-unit cost and poor material utilization** (high waste). It is not economically scalable as a primary shaping method for high volumes but is essential for prototyping and adding complex features to pre-formed blanks.
*   **Filament Wound CFRP:** The dominant constraint is **high and volatile raw material cost**. Carbon fiber prices can fluctuate 25-30% quarterly, creating supply chain uncertainty[^79]. While manufacturing scale improvements are reducing costs by ~15-20% annually, it remains a premium option. The process itself is automatable and scalable, but cost limits it to premium/performance segments.
*   **Hybrid Routes:** Involve greater manufacturing complexity (multiple materials, joining steps), leading to higher costs and currently lower scalability for mass production.

**Geometric Capabilities & Precision Tolerances:**
*   **Precision Machining:** **Unmatched capability for creating complex internal and external geometries**, such as intricate internal cooling ducts, fins, splines, and high-precision bearing seats. It can achieve the tightest tolerances (e.g., ±0.005") and finest surface finishes.
*   **Filament Wound CFRP:** Excellent for cylindrical and axisymmetric shapes. Dimensional accuracy is good but achieving metal-grade tolerances on critical interfaces often requires secondary machining. Creating complex internal features is very challenging.
*   **Hybrid Routes:** Geometric capabilities depend on the core forming process for the metal component, with composites adding constraints.

**Required Post-Processing & Integration Steps:**
*   **Precision Machining:** Often *is* the post-processing for other blanks. If used as the primary method, it may still require heat treatment and balancing.
*   **Filament Wound CFRP:** Requires curing, mandrel removal, and often secondary machining of metal end fittings for attachment. Balancing is also critical.
*   **Hybrid Routes:** Involve the most steps: forming/ machining the metal core, preparing and applying the composite, curing, and final machining/balancing. Joining methods like press-fitting with mechanical interlocking or laser welding are critical.

**Resultant Mechanical & Dynamic Properties:**
*   **Precision Machining:** Properties depend on the base material. It can achieve high strength but often with a weight penalty if starting from solid stock.
*   **Filament Wound CFRP:** Delivers **breakthrough performance in mass efficiency and NVH**. **CFRP shafts possess five to ten times the torsional damping of steel shafts**, significantly reducing vibration[^77]. Hybrid aluminum/CFRP shafts have demonstrated a **75% mass reduction with a 160% increase in torque capability** compared to conventional steel shafts[^77].
*   **Hybrid Routes:** Aim to optimize multiple properties. The "Hybrid Shaft Approach" combining CFRP and steel targets a **~50% mass reduction**[^77].

**Alignment with NEV Market Segments:**
*   **Premium/Performance Segment:** **Filament-wound CFRP and advanced hybrid routes are strongly aligned here**, where maximum weight savings, extended range, and superior NVH refinement justify higher costs. The market for carbon-fiber shafts is projected to grow at a 14.33% CAGR[^79].
*   **Mass-Market Segment:** The high cost and material volatility of CFRP are significant barriers. Precision machining is not scalable. Therefore, advanced metal-forming (e.g., DOM with rotary swaging) remains the dominant scalable solution for this segment, though hybrid metal designs (e.g., flowformed/welded) present an innovative middle ground.

### 4.3 Trade-off Analysis: Performance Claims vs. Manufacturing Realities

This section synthesizes comparative data to explicitly map the critical trade-offs between desired performance attributes and manufacturing feasibility, verifying specific claims from the reference materials.

**Weight Reduction vs. Cost and Process Complexity:**
*   **Claim:** Rotary swaging can achieve **over 30% weight reduction** for a hollow motor shaft[^11][^73].
*   **Reality & Trade-off:** This claim is validated for specific applications. However, achieving this requires a multi-pass forming process with precise control[^11]. The trade-off includes **high die costs for rolling-based methods** and the need for careful attention to wall thickness control to avoid defects like buckling[^11][^76]. The process offers high efficiency and fine surface quality but demands significant upfront investment in tooling and machinery[^74].

**Strength Enhancement vs. Distortion Risk:**
*   **Claim:** Quenching and tempering treatment increased the yield strength in the rotary-swaged region by **27.5%** compared to the undeformed region[^11][^73].
*   **Reality & Trade-off:** While heat treatment is highly effective for enhancing strength, it introduces a major challenge for thin-walled hollow shafts: **distortion**. Uneven heating and cooling can warp the precise geometry, necessitating costly corrective machining or the use of controlled-atmosphere furnaces and fixtures, adding to process complexity and cost.

**Ultimate Lightweighting vs. Scalability and Supply Chain Risk:**
*   **Claim:** Hybrid composite shafts can achieve **50-75% mass reduction** with increased torque capacity[^77].
*   **Reality & Trade-off:** These performance claims are transformative for vehicle range and efficiency. The trade-off is severe: **high cost, complex multi-step manufacturing, and vulnerability to raw material price volatility** (e.g., carbon fiber)[^79]. This makes scaling to millions of units per year economically and logistically challenging compared to established metal supply chains.

**Design Freedom for Cooling vs. Production Economics:**
*   **Claim:** Complex internal cooling channels can drastically improve thermal management.
*   **Reality & Trade-off:** **Precision machining offers the greatest design freedom** for internal ducts and fins. However, as a primary manufacturing method, it is slow, wasteful, and costly for high volumes. The trade-off forces a choice: either accept the cost penalty of machining for optimal thermal performance, or design cooling systems that can be integrated into more scalable, near-net-shape forming processes, which may limit geometric complexity.

**The following table summarizes the core trade-off matrix across key dimensions:**

| **Technology Route** | **Strength-to-Weight Ratio** | **Production Scalability (High Vol.)** | **Unit Cost at High Volume** | **Geometric Complexity Capability** | **Supply Chain Maturity** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DOM / Advanced Forging** | High | **Excellent** | **Low** | Moderate (Good for external, limited for internal) | **Very High** |
| **Precision Machining** | Depends on material | Poor | Very High | **Excellent** | High |
| **Filament-Wound CFRP** | **Exceptional** | Good (Process) / Poor (Cost) | Very High | Low to Moderate | Low (Volatile raw materials) |
| **Hybrid (Metal/Composite)** | **Exceptional** | Poor | Highest | Moderate | Lowest |

### 4.4 Scalability, Cost, and Supply Chain Implications for NEV Production

Selecting a manufacturing technology for NEVs necessitates a deep understanding of volume thresholds, cost structures, and supply chain integration within the fast-paced automotive environment.

**Scalability Thresholds and Volume-Based Economics:** Production volume critically determines economic viability. Low-volume production (1-10,000 units) favors flexible processes like **CNC machining** due to low setup costs, despite higher per-unit cost[^80][^81]. The transition to high-volume manufacturing is typically considered at **>50,000 units annually**, where dedicated forming processes become advantageous[^80]. For example, cost curves show that for a sheet metal part, laser cutting/bending has a cost asymptote near **$3.73 per part**, while a progressive die stamping process asymptotes near **$0.50 per part** at high volumes[^80][^82]. Similarly, for a metal component, switching from CNC machining to die casting becomes economical at around **1,000 units**, with annual savings exceeding $300,000 at 10,000 units[^80][^82]. For hollow shafts, processes like **rotary swaging, cold forging, and DOM tube production are engineered for these high-volume regimes**, where high initial tooling costs are amortized over millions of units.

**Cost Structure Analysis:** The total cost comprises fixed and variable costs. High-volume metal-forming routes have **high fixed costs (equipment, tooling)** but **very low variable costs per unit**. In contrast, machining has lower fixed costs but high variable costs (material waste, labor). Composite routes have **extremely high variable costs dominated by raw material prices**, which are subject to severe fluctuation. An analysis of additive vs. conventional manufacturing showed that for parts with low material efficiency ("solid-to-envelope ratio" α between 0.08 and 0.22), AM could be more energy-efficient, but this often doesn't translate to cost-effectiveness at automotive scales[^81].

**Supply Chain Complexity and Localization:**
*   **Metal Forming:** Benefits from mature, global supply chains for steel and aluminum. The trend is towards further localization and integration. For instance, ZF Group emphasizes local R&D and manufacturing in China to adapt to "China speed," producing electric axle drives and reducers locally[^83][^84].
*   **Composites:** The supply chain is less mature, with **carbon fiber production concentrated among few global players**, leading to volatility. Integrating composite component manufacturing into a high-volume automotive assembly line adds complexity.
*   **Vertical Integration:** Leading NEV manufacturers like BYD demonstrate a strategy of **vertical integration, manufacturing about 75% of components (including batteries, motors, semiconductors) in-house** to control cost, quality, and supply chain stability[^85][^86]. This strategy favors manufacturing technologies that can be tightly controlled and scaled within the OEM's ecosystem, potentially favoring metal-forming over composite outsourcing.

**Operational Challenges:** Implementing advanced forming technologies like CNC rotary swaging requires **skilled technicians for setup, calibration, and maintenance**. In regions with limited access to such skills, machine utilization can suffer[^74][^76]. Furthermore, integrating these machines with upstream and downstream automation (robotic handling, inspection) requires careful production line design and investment.

### 4.5 Synthesis: Mapping Technology Routes to NEV Application Scenarios

This concluding section synthesizes the in-depth comparison to provide a clear mapping of recommended manufacturing routes to specific NEV application scenarios, creating a decision framework based on the weighted importance of the evaluation criteria.

**Scenario 1: High-Volume, Cost-Sensitive Mass-Market Platforms**
*   **Priority Criteria:** Cost-effectiveness, Scalability, Supply Chain Robustness, Balanced Performance.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Advanced Metal Forming, primarily based on DOM tubing with secondary forming (e.g., rotary swaging, flowforming).**
*   **Justification:** This route offers the best compromise. DOM provides excellent precision and strength at a competitive cost. Secondary forming adds necessary geometric features (steps, tapers) and can enhance properties. The processes are highly automatable, scalable to millions of units, and leverage stable metal supply chains. It reliably meets core requirements for strength, weight reduction (~20-30%), and integration.

**Scenario 2: Premium, Performance, or Long-Range Focused Vehicles**
*   **Priority Criteria:** Maximum Strength-to-Weight Ratio, NVH Refinement, Thermal Performance, Accepting Higher Cost.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Filament-Wound CFRP shafts or Advanced Hybrid Metal-Composite designs.**
*   **Justification:** When range and driving refinement are paramount and can command a price premium, CFRP's exceptional specific strength and damping are unmatched. Hybrid approaches offer a path to even greater performance integration (e.g., combined cooling). While costs are high, they are decreasing with scale, making this route increasingly viable for the premium segment.

**Scenario 3: Prototyping, Low-Volume/Specialty Vehicles, and Complex Feature Integration**
*   **Priority Criteria:** Design Flexibility, Geometric Complexity, Low Setup Cost, Speed to Market.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Precision CNC Machining (from solid or tube blanks) potentially combined with additive manufacturing for prototypes.**
*   **Justification:** Machining is indispensable for design validation, creating complex internal cooling geometries that are not feasible with forming, and for low-volume production where tooling for forming is unjustified. It serves as the critical secondary process for all routes, adding splines, bearing seats, and other precision features to near-net-shape blanks.

**Scenario 4: Innovative, Integrated Drive Unit Designs**
*   **Priority Criteria:** Functional Integration (e.g., cooling, structural), Lightweighting, System Compactness.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Hybrid Manufacturing Strategies.** This may involve a **metal core (e.g., flowformed steel) for strength and thermal management, with selective use of composites or topological optimization, and extensive use of precision machining for final features and interfaces.** Additive manufacturing may also play a role in creating complex, integrated components like housings with cooling channels[^83].
*   **Justification:** The drive towards ultra-compact, efficient "e-axles" demands components that serve multiple functions. A hybrid approach allows engineers to select the best process and material for each sub-function, potentially leading to breakthrough designs, albeit with higher development and manufacturing complexity.

This synthesis reveals a stratified technology landscape. No single route dominates; instead, the optimal path is determined by the vehicle's market positioning, performance targets, and production volume. The following chapter will translate this mapping into concrete strategic recommendations and a future outlook.

## 5 Synthesis and Recommendation of Optimal Manufacturing Pathways

This chapter synthesizes the comparative findings from the previous analysis to provide concrete, scenario-based recommendations for the optimal manufacturing of hollow motor shafts in NEV electric drive units. It explicitly maps manufacturing routes—including advanced metal forming, composite fabrication, and hybrid strategies—to specific NEV application scenarios defined by performance tier, production volume, and cost sensitivity. The chapter leverages reference materials to justify recommendations with data-driven insights, such as the demonstrated weight reduction and strength gains from specific processes, market growth projections for advanced materials, and the economic implications of prevailing OEM strategies. It also explores the role of emerging technologies in future hybrid pathways and discusses key implementation considerations, including scalability, supply chain maturity, and strategic alignment with industry trends.

### 5.1 Scenario-Based Recommendation Framework: Mapping Technology to NEV Market Segments

The optimal manufacturing route for a hollow NEV motor shaft is not universal but is determined by the specific priorities of the vehicle segment. By weighting the evaluation criteria established in Chapter 3, we can define a clear decision framework that maps technologies to three primary NEV application scenarios.

**Scenario 1: High-Volume, Cost-Sensitive Mass-Market Platforms**
*   **Priority Criteria:** **Cost-effectiveness and production scalability are paramount**, followed by a robust supply chain and reliable, balanced mechanical performance.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Advanced Metal Forming based on Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) tubing with secondary forming processes like rotary swaging or flowforming.**
*   **Justification:** This route offers the best compromise for volumes reaching millions of units annually. Hollow shaft designs are emphasized industry-wide for weight reduction and improved fuel efficiency, with hollow designs capturing approximately 68% of the interconnecting shaft market share in 2025[^79]. The rotary swaging process, an incremental radial forming method, has been proven feasible for manufacturing hollow motor shafts, achieving **over 30% weight reduction** in trial productions for railway applications[^73][^87][^88]. DOM tubing itself provides superior concentricity and uniform wall thickness, which are critical for precise fitment and balance in integrated drive units. The process benefits from the mature, scalable supply chains for high-strength steels and alloys, making it a **cost-effective and low-risk choice for mainstream EV production**[^79].

**Scenario 2: Premium, Performance, and Long-Range Focused Vehicles**
*   **Priority Criteria:** **Maximum strength-to-weight ratio and NVH refinement** are the primary drivers, with a higher tolerance for cost to achieve extended range and superior driving dynamics.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Filament-wound Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) shafts.**
*   **Justification:** When performance justifies a price premium, CFRP delivers unmatched benefits. The material enables a **60% weight reduction compared to steel**, which directly enhances vehicle range and allows for longer shaft designs without critical speed limitations[^79]. The automotive drive shaft market projects **carbon-fiber/CFRP shafts to grow at a 14.33% CAGR**, driven by adoption in performance and premium segments[^79]. Furthermore, **CFRP shafts possess superior torsional damping**, significantly improving Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) characteristics—a key differentiator for premium vehicles[^79]. While manufacturing scale improvements are reducing costs by 15-20% annually, raw material price volatility remains a constraint, anchoring this technology to the premium segment for the foreseeable future[^79].

**Scenario 3: Prototyping, Low-Volume/Specialty Vehicles, and Complex Feature Integration**
*   **Priority Criteria:** **Design flexibility, geometric complexity capability, and low setup cost** are critical, with less emphasis on per-unit production economics.
*   **Recommended Route:** **Precision CNC Machining (from solid or pre-formed tubular blanks).**
*   **Justification:** Machining is indispensable for design validation and creating features not feasible with forming. It offers the ultimate capability for **integrating complex internal cooling channels, ducts, and fins** essential for advanced thermal management studies[^89]. For low volumes, the high material waste and slower speed are offset by the absence of expensive dedicated tooling. This route also serves as the essential secondary process for adding precision splines, bearing seats, and other interface features to near-net-shape blanks produced by any other primary method.

### 5.2 Justification of Primary Routes: Data-Driven Analysis of Metal Forming and Composite Fabrication

The recommendations above are anchored in specific performance data and market trends extracted from the reference materials.

**Advanced Metal Forming (Rotary Swaging & Near-Net-Shape Forging):**
The case for rotary swaging is supported by comprehensive research. A detailed FEM analysis and experimental validation of a hot rotary swaging process for a railway motor shaft confirmed its feasibility, with the formed shaft showing stable outer dimensions[^73][^87]. **Microstructural analysis revealed a recrystallization fraction of 72.29% in the swaged region**, indicating significant grain refinement[^73][^87]. Subsequent **quenching and tempering treatment increased the yield strength in this region by 27.5% compared to the undeformed base material**, while also improving plasticity[^73][^87]. The trial production resulted in a **hollow shaft with a length of 635 mm and a maximum outer diameter of Φ105mm, achieving the critical over 30% weight reduction**[^73][^87][^88]. This demonstrates a process capable of delivering both lightweighting and enhanced mechanical properties.

An alternative advanced metal forming route is highlighted in patent US9446445B2, which describes a near-net-shape forging process for hollow shafts. This method aims to enhance material utilization from forging through proof machining. The process significantly reduces input weight by about **30% and cuts machining time by approximately 40-45%** compared to conventional methods that start with a solid forged bar[^78]. This approach is particularly relevant for high-power applications and underscores the industry's drive towards processes that minimize waste and secondary processing.

**Composite Fabrication (Filament-Wound CFRP):**
The justification for CFRP shafts is rooted in their transformative potential for vehicle performance. Market analysis indicates a rapid adoption curve, with carbon-fiber composite shafts expanding at a forecasted **12.62% CAGR by design type and 14.33% CAGR by material through 2031**[^79]. This growth is driven by mandates for weight reduction and NVH improvement, with applications accelerating from premium into performance-oriented mainstream vehicles[^79]. Technically, studies on composite drive shaft design confirm the potential for drastic weight reduction—**up to 97% compared to steel** in theoretical optimizations—while maintaining or enhancing torque capacity[^77]. The core value proposition is the unparalleled **specific strength and stiffness**, which directly translates to extended driving range and improved energy efficiency, critical metrics for NEV competitiveness.

### 5.3 Hybrid and Multi-Stage Manufacturing Strategies for Enhanced Performance

To overcome the limitations of single-process routes and achieve multi-functional integration, innovative hybrid strategies are emerging. These combine materials and processes to unlock superior performance.

**Metal-Composite Hybrid Structures:** One promising strategy involves combining a metal core (for torque transmission and structural integrity) with a composite layer (for mass reduction and dynamic tuning). Research into optimized designs demonstrates the potential for **dramatic mass reductions—up to 75%—alongside significant increases in torque capability** compared to conventional steel shafts[^89]. This approach can also be tailored to increase the bending natural frequency, enabling longer one-piece shaft designs.

**Integration of Additive Manufacturing (AM):** AM offers unique capabilities for functional integration, particularly for thermal management. Studies show that **electric motor housings with AM-integrated cooling channels can achieve a 37% increase in cooling capacity and a 16% weight reduction**[^83]. For shafts, a strategic application could involve using AM to create **complex near-contour cooling channels** within a gear or shaft component, a strategy noted for reducing gear temperatures by up to 40 K and improving efficiency[^83]. Hybrid manufacturing systems that join AM with 5-axis machining in a single setup are defined by their high flexibility and ability to produce parts with complex geometries and good surface finish, while minimizing material waste and transport time[^89]. This makes them suitable for prototyping, tooling, and low-volume production of highly integrated components.

**Advanced Forming Hybrids:** The process of rotary swaging itself can be part of a hybrid sequence. For instance, a billet is first prepared with a deep-drilled inner bore, then undergoes multiple passes of rotary swaging to form a nearly enclosed internal cavity, followed by precision machining[^73][^88]. This combines plastic deformation for shape and property enhancement with machining for final accuracy.

### 5.4 Implementation Considerations: Scalability, Supply Chain, and OEM Strategic Alignment

Selecting a technology requires moving beyond technical specifications to assess practical integration within the global NEV manufacturing ecosystem.

**Scalability and Volume Thresholds:** The automotive industry's shift to electrification demands solutions that scale to millions of units per year. **Hollow shaft designs are expected to witness faster growth with increasing EV sales**, making scalable manufacturing critical[^90]. Processes like rotary swaging and DOM tube production are engineered for high-volume output. In contrast, while AM and complex hybrid routes offer design freedom, their current economics and production rates present challenges for mass-market volumes, aligning them more closely with premium segments or specialized components[^89].

**Supply Chain Implications:** A technology's viability is heavily dependent on its supply chain maturity and stability.
*   **Metal Forming:** Benefits from deeply established, localized supply chains for steel and aluminum. This is evidenced by major tier-1 suppliers like ZF Group aggressively localizing production; ZF Transmissions Shanghai now designs and manufactures NEV reducers wholly for the Chinese market, and ZF has opened new electric axle drive plants in Shenyang, emphasizing adaptation to "China speed"[^83][^84].
*   **Composites:** Face a significant constraint in **raw material price volatility**. **Carbon fiber prices can fluctuate 25-30% quarterly** due to supply chain bottlenecks and concentrated production, creating cost uncertainty for OEMs[^79]. This volatility is a key barrier to widespread adoption outside of premium segments.

**Alignment with OEM Strategies:** Leading NEV manufacturers are shaping the technology landscape through their vertical integration strategies. BYD exemplifies this, **manufacturing about 75% of its vehicle components in-house**, including batteries, motors, and power electronics[^85][^86]. This model prioritizes control over cost, quality, and supply chain stability. Such a strategy inherently favors manufacturing technologies that can be reliably scaled and controlled within the OEM's ecosystem, such as advanced metal forming. It also drives the need for rapid local R&D and manufacturing capabilities, as highlighted by ZF's Asia Pacific team leading the entire process from customer nomination to product rollout[^83].

### 5.5 Future Outlook: Evolving Materials, Processes, and Industry Trends

The manufacturing landscape for NEV hollow shafts will continue to evolve, driven by relentless innovation in materials, processes, and system architectures.

**Materials Evolution:** The pursuit of lighter and stronger materials will persist. **Advanced high-strength steels and alloys** will continue to be optimized for formability and strength. The cost trajectory of **carbon fiber is key**; with manufacturing scale improvements driving annual cost reductions of 15-20%, its economic viability for broader market segments will improve[^79]. Research into new composite matrices and hybrid material systems (e.g., metal matrix composites) will also advance.

**Process Innovation and Hybridization:** The trend towards **hybrid manufacturing processes will intensify**. The combination of additive manufacturing for complex geometry with subtractive machining for precision and forming for efficiency represents a powerful future pathway[^89]. Processes like rotary swaging will see further refinement in precision and automation. The industry will also develop more sophisticated **multi-physics simulation models** to optimize these hybrid process chains and predict final component performance[^89].

**Impact of Next-Generation EV Architectures:** The evolution of electric drive units will directly dictate shaft requirements. The rise of **integrated e-axles** reduces the need for traditional multi-piece propeller shafts but increases demand for high-precision, lightweight interconnecting shafts within compact modules[^79]. The transition to **800V platforms** and the use of **silicon carbide (SiC) power electronics** will enable higher power densities, placing even greater emphasis on thermal management solutions that hollow shaft designs can facilitate[^84]. Furthermore, innovations in drivetrain lubrication, such as systems where the gearbox lubricant also cools the motor via the hollow rotor shaft, will become more prevalent, demanding compatible shaft designs and materials[^84].

**Sustainability and Circular Economy:** Environmental considerations will become increasingly important. This will drive the selection of materials with lower embodied energy, the development of more energy-efficient manufacturing processes, and the design of shafts for disassembly and recyclability—particularly challenging for composite materials. Lifecycle assessment will become a standard part of the technology selection process.

**In conclusion, the optimal manufacturing pathway for hollow NEV motor shafts is a strategic choice aligned with vehicle segment priorities. For the foreseeable future, advanced metal forming will dominate the high-volume mass market due to its unbeatable combination of performance, cost, and scalability. Composite routes will continue to capture the premium segment, with their adoption breadth hinging on continued cost reduction. The most significant innovations will likely emerge from hybrid strategies that combine the strengths of multiple processes and materials to create the next generation of ultra-efficient, high-performance electric drive units.**
