# Interannual Dynamics of Chub Mackerel: Linking Biological Traits, Market Prices, and Oceanographic Drivers in the Pacific Rim
## 1 The Chub Mackerel: Biological Foundation and Fishery Significance

This chapter establishes the comprehensive biological and ecological baseline for *Scomber japonicus*, providing the foundational context necessary for understanding the interannual dynamics of this species in the Pacific Rim. By systematically examining the taxonomic classification, geographic distribution patterns, key life history traits, and commercial significance of chub mackerel, this chapter sets the stage for subsequent analyses linking biological characteristics to market prices and oceanographic drivers. Understanding the biological foundation of this economically important species is essential for interpreting how environmental variability translates into changes in fish populations and, ultimately, into market dynamics across Pacific Rim countries.

### 1.1 Taxonomic Classification and Species Identification

*Scomber japonicus* (Houttuyn, 1782), commonly known as the **chub mackerel**, Pacific mackerel, or Pacific chub mackerel, belongs to the family **Scombridae** (mackerels, tunas, and bonitos) within the order **Scombriformes**[^1][^2]. The taxonomic classification follows the hierarchy: Phylum Vertebrata, Class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes), Order Perciformes (though now often placed in Scombriformes), and Family Scombridae[^3]. This placement within the Scombridae family positions chub mackerel among some of the most commercially valuable pelagic fishes in the world's oceans.

**Historical synonymies and taxonomic clarifications** are critical for accurate species identification in fisheries research and market transactions. The species has historically been confused with closely related congeners, leading to significant taxonomic revisions. Notably, reports of *Scomber japonicus* from the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, are actually *Scomber colias* (Atlantic chub mackerel), while reports from the Red Sea and northern Indian Ocean represent *Scomber australasicus*[^1]. It is important to note that *Scomber australasicus* Cuvier 1832 is itself a valid species that appears to be distributed only in the Australasian region; it was previously misidentified as a synonym for *S. japonicus* in the eastern Pacific[^3]. Additionally, a new species, *Scomber indicus*, was described from the Indian Ocean in 2015, further refining the taxonomic understanding of this genus[^2].

The following table summarizes the key morphological features distinguishing chub mackerel from its closest relatives:

| Feature | *Scomber japonicus* (Chub Mackerel) | *Scomber colias* (Atlantic Chub Mackerel) | *Scomber scombrus* (Atlantic Mackerel) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Swim Bladder** | Well-developed, attached to esophagus | Present | Absent |
| **First Dorsal Fin Spines** | 9-10 spines | Similar | 11 or more spines |
| **Lateral Coloration** | Lower sides mottled with small dusky blotches | Silvery-sided below midline | Distinct wavy lines |
| **Eye Size** | Larger eye | Smaller eye | Moderate |
| **Dorsal Fin Spacing** | Fins closer together | Similar | More widely spaced |

The presence of a **well-developed swim bladder attached to the esophagus** is a particularly diagnostic feature, as "true mackerels" in the genus *Scomber* typically lack this structure[^2]. The characteristic color difference between chub mackerel and Atlantic chub mackerel—with the former displaying mottled lower sides and the latter being silvery-sided below the midline—provides an important visual identification criterion[^2]. Furthermore, the first dorsal fin of chub mackerel contains **9-10 fin spines**, compared to 10-13 in some other mackerel species, while the distinction from blue mackerel (*Scomber australasicus*) can be made by observing that chub mackerel display black or blue spots whereas blue mackerel show almost no spots[^4].

The **fossil record** of *Scomber japonicus* extends to the Pliocene of Italy, with specimens dating from approximately 3 to 2.2 million years ago, indicating a long evolutionary history for this species[^2]. This paleontological evidence suggests that the genus *Scomber* has maintained relatively stable morphological characteristics over geological time scales, which supports the reliability of morphological identification criteria used in contemporary fisheries science.

### 1.2 Geographic Distribution and Habitat Characteristics

Chub mackerel exhibits a remarkably **extensive global distribution**, spanning the temperate and subtropical waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans[^3][^5]. However, the species' distribution is described as **anti-tropical in the Indo-Pacific**, meaning it is largely absent from equatorial waters and instead concentrated in the subtropical and temperate zones of both hemispheres[^1]. This distribution pattern has significant implications for understanding how climate-driven changes in ocean temperature may affect the species' range and abundance.

In the **Atlantic Ocean**, *S. japonicus* occurs along the eastern coast of North America from Nova Scotia, Canada, to Venezuela, the southeastern coast of South America from southeastern Brazil to southern Argentina, the European coast from Britain to France, almost the entire African coast, and throughout the Mediterranean and Red Seas[^3]. However, it is notably **absent from the Indian Ocean** except for a limited range in South Africa from KwaZulu-Natal to the Western Cape[^1][^2]. In the **Pacific Ocean**, the species is widely distributed in the northwestern, southeastern, and northeastern regions, with major fishing grounds in Japanese waters, the East China Sea, and along the western coast of the Americas from Southeast Alaska to central Mexico[^2][^3].

The following diagram illustrates the major distribution regions of chub mackerel in the Pacific Rim:

In the **Northwest Pacific Ocean (NPO)**, which is the focus of this research, chub mackerel is distributed from the coast of southern Japan to offshore waters of the Kuril Islands, with both adults and juveniles found as far east as 170°E[^6]. The **main spawning ground** is located within the Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone, specifically in the **Izu Island waters**[^6]. A significant recent finding is that the **feeding migration of adults has expanded northeast**, and since 2018, the distribution during summer and fall has reached 47°N, 166°E[^6]. This northward expansion represents a notable shift in the species' historical range and is attributed to climate warming effects on sea surface temperature[^5].

Regarding **habitat characteristics**, chub mackerel is classified as a **marine, pelagic-neritic, and oceanodromous species**[^1]. The species typically inhabits depths ranging from **0 to 300 meters**, with most individuals found between **50 and 200 meters**[^1][^7]. Temperature tolerance spans **10°C to 27°C**, with adults preferring temperatures of **15-20°C**[^1][^7]. The latitudinal range extends from 60°N to 48°S, and longitudinally from 116°E to 70°W[^1].

In the **Southeast Pacific**, the distribution extends from Panama to Chile, including the Galápagos Islands, with a southern limit at Guamblin Island (45°41'S)[^3]. The longitudinal distribution extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the coast, particularly in the southern region (offshore Chile), while in the northern region (offshore Peru and Ecuador) most fish are found within 100 nautical miles of the coast[^3]. Russian surveys in the Southeast Pacific high seas have documented that *S. japonicus* eggs are distributed in a narrow band adjacent to the 200-nautical-mile boundary (approximately 13°S to 18°S), with eggs and larvae found in a broader area further offshore (35°S-40°S and 80°W-90°W)[^3].

The species demonstrates **seasonal migration patterns** that are closely tied to spawning and feeding cycles. In the western North Pacific, the **Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) stock** spawns from February to June mainly in the East China Sea and Korea Strait, after which it migrates to its northern feeding grounds in the Japan/East Sea and Yellow Sea through the Korea Strait[^8]. This migratory behavior has important implications for fisheries management, as fish are accessible to different national fleets at different times of year.

### 1.3 Life History Traits: Growth, Reproduction, and Feeding Ecology

Understanding the life history traits of chub mackerel is fundamental to interpreting interannual variations in weight and length, as these biological parameters directly influence the size composition of commercial catches and, consequently, market prices.

#### Growth Characteristics

Chub mackerel exhibits **rapid growth during the first two years of life**, characterized by high growth rates that allow fish to reach approximately 50% of their asymptotic length within this period[^3]. The maximum body length is approximately **45 cm**, with a lifespan ranging from **9 to 10 years**[^3]. However, recent stock assessments have documented significant temporal variations in growth parameters, with important implications for fisheries management.

The **von Bertalanffy Growth Function (VBGF)** has been consistently identified as the best model for describing the age-length relationship in chub mackerel populations[^9][^10]. Research on Atlantic chub mackerel in the northwest Atlantic yielded the following parameter estimates: **L∞ = 33.56 cm TL, k = 1.75 y⁻¹, and t₀ = 0.07 y**[^9]. These parameters indicate rapid initial growth with an asymptotic length somewhat smaller than the maximum recorded length, reflecting the mathematical properties of the growth model.

Studies in the Northwest Pacific have documented **growth heterogeneity** across years, seasons, and regions[^10]. Analysis of 2,686 specimens (fork length 40-294 mm; body weight 0.8-311.8 g) collected from Chinese fishing vessels between 2016-2020 revealed a length-weight relationship of **W = (1.41 × 10⁻⁶) × FL³·³⁷**, indicating positive allometric growth[^10]. Importantly, individual chub mackerel in recent years exhibited a **slower growth rate** than observed in previous studies, suggesting temporal changes in growth conditions[^10].

The following table summarizes key growth parameters from different studies and regions:

| Study Region | Period | L∞ (cm) | k (y⁻¹) | Growth Coefficient | Notes |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Northwest Atlantic | Recent | 33.56 TL | 1.75 | - | Atlantic chub mackerel |
| Northwest Pacific | 2016-2021 | 36.2-41.3 FL | - | - | Interannual variation |
| Southern East China Sea | Historical | - | - | 0.060-0.079 | Larval growth |
| North Satsunan Area | 2018-2019 | - | - | 0.072-0.078 | Larval growth |

Stock assessment data reveal that the **asymptotic fork length (L∞) varied from 36.2 cm (2019) to 41.3 cm (2020)** in the high seas of the Northwest Pacific, demonstrating substantial interannual variability[^5]. The stock has experienced **large changes in biological parameters** over the model time period, notably a recent decrease in maturity-at-age and weight-at-age, which cause temporal variations in biological reference points[^6].

For larval stages, growth analysis based on otolith daily rings in the North Satsunan area showed instantaneous growth rates and daily specific growth rates comparable to those in the Southern East China Sea (the species' primary spawning and nursery ground), with growth coefficients of **0.072-0.078** and daily specific growth rates of **7.5-8.1% body length/day**[^11].

#### Reproductive Biology

Chub mackerel is a **gonochoristic (separate sexes) species with no evidence of sexual dimorphism**[^3]. Histological studies confirm that it is a **batch spawner** with an extended reproductive activity period[^3][^9]. The spawning season varies geographically: in Peruvian waters, spawning occurs from August to March with peak activity in midsummer; near Ecuador, a secondary spawning period exists in September; and in Chilean waters, spawning is documented from November to March[^3].

In the Northwest Atlantic, Atlantic chub mackerel spawning occurs from **January to April**, based on histological indicators, the presence of spawning-capable males in October, larval frequency analysis from plankton surveys, and a decline in commercial catch from December to February suggesting southward migration to spawn[^9]. The **length at 50% maturity (L₅₀)** for females was estimated at **27.39 cm TL**, corresponding to an **age at 50% maturity of approximately 2.16 years**[^9].

Chinese fisheries data indicate that **0-1+ age individuals are not mature, 2+ age individuals have at least 30-40% maturity, 3+ age individuals are almost fully mature, and individuals older than 4 years show 100% maturity**, though this situation varies from year to year[^4]. The estimated 50% sexual maturity length in northern Chile was reported as **26 cm**[^3].

A critical finding for understanding interannual variations is that chub mackerel functions largely as a **capital breeder**, relying primarily on stored reserves rather than dietary resources during spawning[^12]. Experimental evidence using stable isotope ratios demonstrated much slower isotopic turnover in chub mackerel eggs compared to income-breeding anchovy, with the estimated degree of dependence on income resources (DI) in eggs being approximately **0.47 by day 31** after a diet switch[^12].

The implications of this capital breeding strategy are profound: **pre-spawning nutritional status significantly influences reproductive outputs**[^12]. Controlled feeding experiments showed that food restriction significantly reduced somatic condition and egg production, with egg production in food-restricted treatments being approximately **38% of that in well-fed treatments**[^12]. Furthermore, larvae from food-restricted females exhibited reduced growth and starvation tolerance, with time to 50% survival being significantly shorter (**78.3 hours vs. 91.7 hours**)[^12]. Food restriction also resulted in smaller eggs and oil globules, with estimated egg energy being approximately **84% of that in well-fed treatments**[^12].

This reproductive strategy provides a mechanistic link between environmental conditions (which affect prey availability and maternal nutritional status) and recruitment success, offering a biological pathway through which oceanographic variability can influence population dynamics and, ultimately, market supply.

#### Feeding Ecology

Chub mackerel is characterized as an **opportunistic predator** with a seasonally variable diet[^3][^7]. The species' trophic level is difficult to determine precisely because stomach contents reveal diverse food items ranging from **phytoplankton to copepods, larvae and juveniles of other fish species**[^3]. This dietary flexibility enables chub mackerel to exploit a wide range of prey resources depending on availability.

Adults consume **small crustaceans (especially copepods), small fish, and squid**, with adults tending to consume larger prey and more fish prey than juveniles[^7]. In the eastern Southeast Pacific waters, adult chub mackerel typically form schools with Chilean jack mackerel and South African pilchard, while individuals smaller than 15 cm also school with Peruvian anchoveta[^3].

Detailed larval feeding studies in the North Satsunan area revealed that **copepods (Calanoida and Harpacticoida), copepod nauplii, cladocerans, ostracods, and appendicularians (tunicates)** were observed in larval guts[^11]. A significant finding was that larvae consume substantial amounts of **appendicularians (larvaceans)** in addition to copepods, with DNA metabarcoding detecting appendicularians more frequently than morphological analysis[^11]. The nutritional pathway involving appendicularians may support chub mackerel feeding habits and facilitate coexistence with other dominant species[^11].

Ontogenetic dietary shifts were documented, with only larger individuals (≥6.0 mm) consuming appendicularians[^11]. DNA metabarcoding analysis identified main food items including copepods from families Calanidae, Paracalanidae, Oithonidae, and Oncaeidae, as well as appendicularians[^11]. The feeding intensity of larvae was relatively low (36.6-40.4% across regions) and similar across all larval size ranges[^11].

### 1.4 Commercial Importance and Global Fishery Production

Chub mackerel represents one of the most economically significant small pelagic fish species globally, with substantial implications for food security, employment, and international trade in Pacific Rim countries.

#### Global Production Scale

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the **annual world production of chub mackerel has exceeded 1.3 million tons** in recent years, with the **Northwest Pacific Ocean accounting for more than 30%** of annual global production[^5]. This positions the Northwest Pacific as the single most important fishing ground for this species worldwide.

The following diagram illustrates the major fishing nations and their relative contributions to chub mackerel catches:

```mermaid
pie title Northwest Pacific Chub Mackerel Fishery (Major Nations)
    "Japan" : 45
    "China" : 35
    "Russia" : 20
```

**Japan has the longest history** of fishing chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific, followed by **China and Russia**[^5]. The resource and catches have experienced **significant fluctuations** since the 1970s, reflecting the inherent variability of small pelagic fish populations[^5]. Due to this variability and the species' ecological and economic importance, **chub mackerel has been listed as a priority management species by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) since 2015**[^5].

#### Historical Catch Trends

Historical total landings have fluctuated dramatically over the past several decades. In the Northwest Pacific, the catch volume of the **Tsushima Warm Current subpopulation** increased from 1979 to 1996, reaching a maximum of **1.12 × 10⁶ tons**; however, catches declined substantially in 1997 and have shown a decreasing trend from 2008 to the present[^13]. The **Pacific Ocean subpopulation** showed an increasing trend in the 1970s, reaching a maximum in 1978 (**1.47 × 10⁶ tons**); after 1978, catches began to decline, reaching a minimum in 1990 (**3 × 10⁴ tons**), with a gradual increase in the 21st century[^13].

Recent data show a concerning decline: total landings **decreased from approximately 516,000 metric tons in 2018 to 151,000 metric tons in calendar year 2023**[^6]. This represents a decline of over 70% in just five years, highlighting the volatility of this fishery and its potential impacts on market supply and prices.

#### Fishing Methods and National Fleets

The major fishing nations employ different gear types and operate in distinct areas:

| Nation | Primary Gear Types | Operating Areas | Catch Composition |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **China** | Light purse seine (>96%), Pelagic trawl (<3%) | NPFC Convention Area | 75-94% chub mackerel (avg. 88%) |
| **Japan** | Purse seine (≥50%), Set net | Japanese EEZ | Mixed mackerel species |
| **Russia** | Mid-water trawl (>90%), Purse seine, Bottom trawl | Russian and Japanese waters | ~100% chub mackerel |

**Chinese fisheries** operate light purse seine and pelagic trawl in the NPFC Convention Area, with chub mackerel fishing records beginning in 2014[^6][^14]. In 2023, China estimated catches of approximately **71,000 tons of mackerels**, with about 95 light purse seine vessels operating[^4]. One to three trawl vessels operate in NPFC areas seasonally, mainly from September to December[^4].

**Japanese fisheries** consist mainly of large purse seine vessels (accounting for ≥50% of catches) and set net operations within national waters[^6]. Japan also conducts extensive scientific surveys, including summer and autumn mid-water trawl surveys (providing recruitment abundance indices) and year-round egg surveys (providing spawning stock biomass indices)[^14].

**Russian fisheries** use mid-water trawl, purse seine, and bottom trawl gears in Russian and Japanese waters, with catches being almost 100% chub mackerel[^6]. Russia has conducted summer acoustic trawl surveys since 2010 to monitor mesopelagic and epipelagic species including chub mackerel[^14].

#### Management Frameworks

The **Conservation and Management Measure (CMM 2024-07)** sets a catch limit of **100,000 metric tons** in the NPFC Convention Area for each of the 2024 and 2025 fishing seasons[^6]. The most recent measure (CMM 2025-07) specifies that the annual total allowable catch in the Convention Area is **66,740 tons** for each 2024 fishing season, with trawl vessels limited to **7,940 tons** and purse seine vessels limited to **58,800 tons** per 2025 fishing season[^14].

In the **Northeastern Pacific**, Pacific mackerel is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), which schedules full benchmark assessments every four years and catch-only projection assessments in interim years[^15]. The harvest guideline for the 2025-26 fishing year is **9,143 metric tons**, based on a projected stock biomass of **61,737 metric tons**[^16][^15].

#### Product Utilization

Chub mackerel is utilized for both **human consumption and fishmeal production**[^17]. In Ecuador, for example, chub mackerel is sold fresh, frozen, and processed, with a significant portion used for fishmeal production[^17]. The 2022 catch of Pacific chub mackerel in Ecuador was **158,121.40 metric tons**[^17]. The United States imported approximately **18,031 metric tons of mackerel** (all product names combined) in 2022, including about **1,202 metric tons from Ecuador**[^17].

### 1.5 Ecological Role and Trophic Significance

Chub mackerel occupies a critical position in marine food webs, serving as both predator and prey at an intermediate trophic level. This ecological role has important implications for understanding how fluctuations in chub mackerel populations may cascade through marine ecosystems and affect the productivity of other fisheries.

#### Position in the Food Web

The species' **trophic level is difficult to determine precisely** due to the diversity of food items found in stomach contents, ranging from phytoplankton to fish larvae[^3]. This dietary flexibility positions chub mackerel as a **key link in energy transfer** from lower trophic levels (plankton) to apex predators. The species is considered an **opportunistic predator** that can exploit a wide range of prey resources depending on availability[^3].

As prey, chub mackerel is consumed by **multiple species including tunas, sharks, dolphins, and whales**[^3]. These characteristics make the species an **important component of the trophic web**, connecting production levels to top predators[^3]. However, quantitative estimates of chub mackerel's contribution to predator diets in the western North Atlantic are limited, partly due to the difficulty of visually distinguishing partially-digested chub mackerel from related species[^7].

A comprehensive study funded to address this data gap examined 758 non-empty stomachs from yellowfin and bigeye tunas (primarily from 2018-2019), along with 36 white marlin and 17 blue marlin stomachs[^7]. The results indicated that **chub mackerel were an exceptionally small component of tuna and marlin diets**: only two chub mackerel were identified in yellowfin tuna stomachs, and seven chub mackerel were identified in two white marlin stomachs[^7]. An earlier study found that chub mackerel made up only **0.2% (by frequency of occurrence)** of dolphinfish diets sampled from North Carolina through Texas[^7].

#### Forage Fish Function

Despite the limited quantitative data on predation rates, chub mackerel is recognized as a **key forage fish** in marine ecosystems. In Ecuador, Pacific chub mackerel has been identified as a **critical forage fish for the marine ecosystem**[^17]. This designation reflects the species' potential importance in supporting higher trophic levels, even if direct predation data are sparse.

The ecological significance of chub mackerel extends beyond direct predation relationships. As a schooling pelagic species that undergoes seasonal migrations, chub mackerel **transfers energy across spatial scales**, connecting productive coastal and shelf waters with offshore ecosystems. This spatial coupling of energy flow has implications for the productivity of fisheries targeting apex predators.

#### Ecosystem-Level Implications

The intermediate trophic position of chub mackerel means that fluctuations in its population can have **cascading effects** both upward and downward in the food web. Declines in chub mackerel abundance may reduce prey availability for apex predators, while increases may enhance predator populations. Conversely, changes in plankton productivity (driven by oceanographic conditions) can affect chub mackerel growth and survival, which then propagates to higher trophic levels.

Understanding these ecological relationships is essential for **ecosystem-based fisheries management**, which seeks to account for interactions among species rather than managing each stock in isolation. The NPFC has recognized the need for such approaches, recommending that managers focus on the **impact of climate warming on marine ecosystem population composition**[^5].

The capital breeding strategy documented for chub mackerel[^12] provides a specific mechanism through which environmental conditions can affect population dynamics. Because pre-spawning nutritional status directly influences reproductive output, variations in prey availability (driven by oceanographic conditions) can translate into variations in recruitment success, population abundance, and ultimately, fishery catches and market supply. This biological pathway represents a key link in the chain connecting oceanographic variability to market economics—a central theme of this research.

## 2 Landscape of Major Aquatic Markets in the Pacific Rim

This chapter provides a comprehensive mapping and characterization of the major aquatic markets across Pacific Rim countries, establishing the broader market context within which chub mackerel is traded. Building upon the biological foundation established in Chapter 1, this chapter examines the structural features, economic scale, and key stakeholders in seafood markets of China, Japan, USA, South Korea, and other relevant nations. The analysis encompasses production trends, international trade flows, regulatory frameworks governing seafood imports and exports, and evolving consumption patterns. This contextualization is essential for understanding how supply-demand dynamics, trade policies, and consumer preferences collectively shape the market environment that determines chub mackerel pricing and commercial viability across the region.

### 2.1 Market Structure and Economic Scale of Pacific Rim Seafood Industries

The Pacific Rim seafood industry represents one of the most economically significant and dynamically evolving sectors in global food trade. Understanding the market structure, valuation, and growth trajectories provides essential context for analyzing how chub mackerel operates within this broader commercial ecosystem.

#### Global Mackerel Market Valuation and Growth Projections

The global mackerel market demonstrates substantial economic scale with robust growth prospects. **The global mackerel market size was valued at USD 13.48 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 17.45 billion by 2030**, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **5.31%** over this period[^18]. This growth trajectory reflects sustained demand for affordable pelagic protein sources and expanding consumption in emerging markets.

Within the species segmentation of the mackerel market, **Atlantic mackerel held the dominant position with 38.18% market share in 2024**[^18]. Chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) constitutes one of the major species segments within this market framework, with global landings of chub mackerel specifically recorded at **1.9 million tonnes in 2022**, making it the largest single mackerel species by catch volume[^19]. This positions chub mackerel as a critical component of the overall mackerel trade, particularly in Pacific Rim markets where the species is most abundant.

The following table summarizes the mackerel market structure by species:

| Species | 2022 Global Landings (MT) | Market Position | Projected Growth |

Indian mackerel is projected to achieve the **fastest compound annual growth rate of 6.74% through 2030**, driven partly by climate warming expanding exploitable waters along the Bay of Bengal coast[^18]. This differential growth across species segments has implications for competitive dynamics affecting chub mackerel market positioning.

#### Regional Market Distribution and Growth Dynamics

The geographic distribution of mackerel market activity reveals significant regional variation in market maturity and growth potential. **Europe led the global mackerel market in 2024 with a 36.85% market share**, reflecting the continent's established processing infrastructure and strong consumer demand for mackerel products[^18]. However, the **Asia-Pacific region represents the fastest-growing market segment**, with a projected CAGR of **6.41%** through 2030[^18].

This regional growth differential is particularly significant for chub mackerel, given that the Northwest Pacific accounts for more than 30% of annual global chub mackerel production. The Asia-Pacific growth trajectory is driven by several factors including rising demand for affordable oceanic protein, expanding canned seafood consumption in emerging Asian markets, and the region's central role in aquaculture feed production requiring fishmeal inputs[^18].

```mermaid

### 2.2 Production Trends and Supply Dynamics Across Key Nations

Understanding production trends across major Pacific Rim nations is essential for contextualizing supply-side factors that influence chub mackerel market dynamics. This section examines fishery and aquaculture production patterns, with particular attention to factors affecting small pelagic species availability.

#### Global Fishery Production Context

Global fish production demonstrates continued growth, with **total production forecast to surpass 190 million tonnes in 2024**[^19]. A significant milestone is that **aquaculture is expected to exceed 100 million tonnes for the first time** in 2024, reflecting the sector's increasing importance in meeting global seafood demand[^19]. Capture fisheries are projected to see a modest **0.2% increase over 2023 levels**, benefiting from improved quotas for major species including Peruvian anchoveta and Alaska pollock[^19].

According to FAO statistics, **global fishery production (excluding aquatic plants and other animals) reached 185.4 million tonnes in 2022**, representing a 1.9% increase from the previous year[^22]. However, global trade patterns have shown recent contraction, with **world fishery exports decreasing by 6% in value and 4% in volume in 2023 compared to 2022**[^22]. Similarly, **world fishery imports declined by 7.3% in value (to USD 166.6 billion) and 5.7% in volume (to 31.970 million MT)** against the previous year[^22].

#### China: The World's Largest Producer and Trader

**China maintains its position as the world's largest fish producer, consumer, and trader**, with profound implications for Pacific Rim market dynamics[^23]. The scale of China's aquatic sector has expanded dramatically, with **aquatic product supply increasing from 4.65 million tonnes in 1978 to 71.16 million tonnes in 2023**, while **per capita annual aquatic product consumption rose from 3.50 kg to 15.20 kg** over the same period[^23].

China's role in global seafood trade is multifaceted. The country functions simultaneously as **the largest exporter despite a 12.3% decline in export value** and as a major importer with **import volumes increasing by 11.4% in 2023**[^22]. The five major importers of fishery products globally are **China, USA (-8.7%), Japan (-4.8%), Thailand (-10.8%), and Spain (-6.3%)**[^22].

China's import patterns for mackerel specifically show significant recent changes. **China's imports of whole frozen mackerel dropped by 41% to 53,670 tonnes in 2023**[^19]. Norway remained China's largest mackerel supplier, accounting for **64.3% of these imports**, though Norwegian exports to China fell by **43.6% to 32,558 tonnes**[^19]. This substantial decline in Chinese mackerel imports reflects broader shifts in demand patterns and has implications for price dynamics across the Pacific Rim.

The structural characteristics of China's seafood sector show a notable shift in the balance between marine capture and aquaculture. **The influence of marine capture fisheries declined from 63.63% of production (1.06 million tonnes) in 1952 to 50.38% (35.85 million tonnes) in 2023**, while **mariculture demonstrates potential for meeting future supply demands, reaching 23.96 million tonnes (66.82% of marine fishery production) in 2023**[^23].

Chub mackerel holds commercial significance in Chinese waters. Among the four traditionally commercially important species in China, only hairtail catches remain high, while **the total volume of pelagic fish has increased**[^24]. In both the East China Sea and Yellow Sea, more valuable long-lived demersal and predatory pelagic species have been replaced by lower value species, **primarily smaller pelagics such as chub mackerel (*Pneumatophorus japonicus*)**[^24].

#### Japan: Declining Production Amid Sustained Import Dependence

Japan's fisheries sector presents a contrasting picture of declining domestic production alongside continued import dependence. **The volume of domestic fisheries and aquaculture production decreased by 90,000 tonnes from the previous year to 3.83 million tonnes in 2023**[^25]. However, the **production value increased by 85.2 billion yen to 1.6853 trillion yen**, the highest level since 2003[^25], suggesting a shift toward higher-value species and products.

**The total supply of domestic consumption of fish and shellfish was estimated at 6.52 million tonnes for FY2023**, of which **5.01 million tonnes (77%) were for human consumption** and 1.51 million tonnes (23%) for non-food uses including feed and fertilizer[^25]. The **self-sufficiency rate of fish and shellfish in FY2023 was 54%**, indicating substantial reliance on imports to meet domestic demand[^25].

Japan's import patterns show relative stability in volume but increasing value. **The import volume of fish and fishery products in 2024 remained at 2.16 million tonnes**, consistent with the previous year, while **import value increased by 2.2% to 2.0613 trillion yen**[^25]. Major import source countries include **China, Chile, and the United States**, with major import items being salmon and trout, shrimp, and skipjack and tuna[^25].

Japan's export sector has faced significant disruption from geopolitical events. **Japan's fishery exports in 2023 decreased significantly following China's total ban on seafood imports from Japan in August 2023**, with **seafood exports to China declining by 57%** compared to the previous year[^22]. The **export volume decreased by 5.5% to 0.45 million tonnes in 2024**, with **export value declining by 7.5% to 360.9 billion yen**[^25]. Major export destinations are Hong Kong, the United States, and Taiwan[^25].

Specific data on chub mackerel stocks in Japan reveal relatively stable cold storage holdings. As of April 30, 2024, **frozen chub mackerel holdings were 74,444 MT**, representing a **0.31% increase from the previous month but a 0.73% decrease compared to the same date in 2023** (74,994 MT)[^22]. This suggests relatively stable domestic supply conditions for chub mackerel in the Japanese market.

#### South Korea: High Consumption with Import Dependence

South Korea represents a significant seafood market characterized by exceptionally high per capita consumption and substantial import requirements. **The Republic of Korea's domestic fish catch is very diversified**, with **Japanese anchovy and Pacific chub mackerel being the main species caught in domestic waters**[^26]. Both species exceed 100,000 tonnes of production but have reported significant declines in recent years[^26].

**Total production in South Korea is declining year on year, down to 1.83 million tonnes in 2022 from 2 million tonnes in 2019**[^26]. Marine capture production specifically was **only 1.2 million tonnes in 2022**, comparing unfavorably to 2 million tonnes at the turn of the century[^26]. This production decline has increased import dependence.

South Korea maintains an important distant water fishery, with **catches from overseas fisheries (including joint ventures) accounting for 45% of total production**[^26]. Production from distant water fisheries is approximately **400,000 tonnes per year**, targeting primarily tunas, cephalopods, and krill in the Antarctic Ocean[^26].

The Republic of Korea's position as a **net-importer of fishery products** is reflected in trade data: **exports of fish and fishery products were USD 2.34 billion while imports were USD 6.1 billion in 2023**[^26]. The country's **self-sufficiency remained around 57% in 2023**, maintaining its status as a net importer of fish and shellfish products[^27].

**Korea's total seafood imports reached USD 5.52 billion in 2024**, representing a **6.9% decrease from the previous year**[^27]. Major suppliers include **China, Russia, Vietnam, Norway, Japan, United States, Peru, Thailand, Canada, and Chile**[^27]. China was the largest supplier in 2024, with a **5.5% value increase from 2023**[^27].

Mackerel specifically features prominently in Korean import patterns. **South Korea imported 41,000 tonnes of Norwegian mackerel in 2023, valued at 1 billion Norwegian kroner**[^18]. The country's largest seafood import categories by value in 2024 included **frozen Alaska pollack, mackerel, Alaska pollack roe, large yellow croaker, and monkfish**[^27].

#### Regional Supply Variability and Climate Impacts

Supply dynamics across the Pacific Rim are increasingly influenced by climate-related factors affecting fish availability and distribution. Research indicates that **climate change is driving chub mackerel spawning grounds to shift toward the western North Atlantic**[^18], with similar distribution shifts documented in the Northwest Pacific where adult feeding migration has expanded northeast, reaching 47°N, 166°E since 2018.

The **North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC)** has responded to supply concerns by implementing catch management measures. The Commission **agreed to reduce the TAC for chub mackerel in the high seas by approximately 30%, from 100,000 tonnes to 71,000 tonnes**[^25]. This quota reduction reflects concerns about stock sustainability and will directly affect supply availability in Pacific Rim markets.

For small pelagics more broadly, **Peruvian anchovy supplies are expected to improve in 2024**. Peru's Institute of the Sea (IMARPE) announced a quota of **2,475,000 tonnes for the first 2024 fishing season**, a significant increase from 2023 seasons severely impacted by El Niño[^19]. In 2023, Peruvian catches for reduction fisheries amounted to only **1,885,000 tonnes**, producing approximately **450,000 tonnes of fishmeal and 14,000 tonnes of fish oil**[^19]. This improvement in anchoveta supplies is expected to ease the tight market for fishmeal and fish oil, with implications for feed costs affecting aquaculture operations that compete for market share with wild-caught species.

### 2.3 International Trade Flows and Market Interdependencies

The Pacific Rim seafood trade is characterized by complex interdependencies among producing, processing, and consuming nations. Understanding these trade flows is essential for analyzing how supply disruptions, policy changes, and demand shifts transmit across markets to affect chub mackerel pricing.

#### Global Trade Pattern Overview

International seafood trade has grown substantially over recent decades, with **all continents experiencing increased aquatic product trade, particularly Asia and Europe as the two major trading regions**[^28]. The historical pattern shows that **aquatic product trade has been dominated by a few countries, including China, the United States, Norway, Thailand, and Japan**[^28].

Since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995, **Asia and South America have been the main trade surplus regions (exports exceeding imports), while Africa and North America have been the main trade deficit regions**[^28]. This structural pattern has important implications for price formation and market power distribution.

The **trophic level of traded aquatic products** reveals important characteristics of trade composition. **Trade trophic levels from all continents from 1976 to 2019 were generally above 3.3**, with national-level import and export trophic level medians above 3 in most countries[^28]. This indicates that **most exported aquaculture and capture fishery products consist of high-trophic-level species oriented toward international markets**, particularly from Europe and Oceania[^28].

An important structural shift is occurring in trade patterns: **in recent decades, the import trophic level of aquatic products in Asia and South America has exceeded the export trophic level, while North America and Europe show the opposite trend**[^28]. This suggests that **Asian and South American countries are developing stronger demand for high-trophic-level (high-value) aquatic species**, gradually redirecting products previously produced mainly for export toward domestic markets[^28].

#### Norway's Dominant Position in Mackerel Exports to Asia

Norway has established itself as a critical supplier of mackerel to Asian markets, with substantial trade volumes and values. **Norwegian exporters shipped 313,242 tonnes of mackerel in 2024, generating revenue of 8.3 billion Norwegian kroner (NOK)**, representing a historic high[^18]. However, **total Norwegian exports of whole frozen mackerel in 2023 were 298,580 tonnes, down 10% from 2022**[^19].

The Asian market represents a particularly important destination for Norwegian mackerel. **Japan demonstrates strong demand for autumn Norwegian mackerel (known as "Saba Nouveau")**, which features fat content twice that of local stocks[^18]. Japan's annual mackerel import demand continues at approximately **100,000 tonnes**[^18].

Norwegian mackerel trade with China has experienced significant contraction. **Norwegian exports to China fell by 43.6% to 32,558 tonnes in 2023**[^19], contributing to the overall 41% decline in Chinese frozen mackerel imports. Despite this decline, **Norway remained China's largest mackerel supplier, accounting for 64.3% of imports**[^19].

#### China's Complex Role as Processor and Re-Exporter

China's position in global seafood trade extends beyond simple import-export relationships to encompass a significant role as a processing hub. **Over two-thirds of China's imports are raw materials that are processed and re-exported**[^28]. This processing function positions China as a critical intermediary in global seafood supply chains, with implications for value addition, quality control, and trade flow patterns.

The processing role is particularly significant for understanding chub mackerel trade dynamics. Products may enter China as whole frozen fish, undergo processing into various product forms, and then be re-exported to final consumption markets. This intermediary function means that Chinese import demand reflects not only domestic consumption but also processing capacity utilization and re-export market conditions.

**China's demand for fishmeal has been restrained**, with **imports in 2023 amounting to 1,650,000 tonnes, a 9% decline from 2022**[^19]. This restraint is linked to low prices in the aquaculture and pig rearing sectors[^19], suggesting that feed ingredient demand from these sectors affects the overall market for small pelagic species including chub mackerel used for reduction purposes.

#### Japan's Trade Disruptions and Market Adjustments

Japan's seafood trade has faced significant disruption from geopolitical events, with cascading effects on market relationships. **Following China's total ban on seafood imports from Japan in August 2023**, Japan's seafood exports to China declined by **57%** compared to the previous year[^22]. This disruption has forced Japanese exporters to seek alternative markets and has affected price dynamics for various species.

Japan's import structure shows diversified sourcing. **Major import source countries include China, Chile, and the United States**[^25], with **major import items being salmon and trout, shrimp, and skipjack and tuna**[^25]. The country's import patterns for mackerel specifically include both Pacific chub mackerel and blue mackerel from Japan's domestic fisheries and imports from Norway and other suppliers.

Historical data on Japanese imports from Russia provide context for trade relationship complexity. **Russia ranked third among Japan's import source countries for fish and fishery products in terms of import value**, with major items including cod roe, salmon roe, sea urchins, and crabs[^29]. As sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, **Japan revoked preferential tariff rates applied to fish and fishery products imported from Russia**, with tariff rates increased for major imports[^29].

#### South Korea's Import Patterns and Market Connections

South Korea's seafood imports demonstrate the country's integration into Pacific Rim trade networks. **Korea imports seafood from roughly 100 different countries**, with major suppliers including **China, Russia, Vietnam, Norway, Japan, United States, Peru, Thailand, Canada, and Chile**[^27]. The diversity of supply sources provides market resilience but also creates complex price transmission mechanisms.

**Korea was the ninth largest global market for fish and seafood with imports of CAD 7.9 billion (3.2% market share) in 2024**[^30], representing an increase in annual value growth of 1.0% from CAD 7.6 billion in 2019[^30]. The country's **top fish and seafood imports in 2024 included frozen shrimp and prawns (CAD 658.3 million), frozen fish not elsewhere specified (CAD 536.9 million), and frozen octopus (CAD 513.9 million)**[^30].

The United States serves as a significant but secondary supplier to Korea. **US seafood imports to Korea amounted to USD 182 million in 2024, down 10.1% year-over-year**, with the United States ranking as **Korea's sixth-largest seafood supplier with a 3.3% market share**[^27]. The **top ten seafood imports from the United States by value in 2024 included Alaska pollack surimi, other fish frozen, fillet of plaice, and frozen Atka mackerel**[^27].

#### Trade Flow Implications for Chub Mackerel Markets

The complex trade relationships across the Pacific Rim create multiple channels through which market conditions in one country affect prices and availability in others. For chub mackerel specifically, several key trade flow characteristics emerge:

1. **Supply concentration**: The Northwest Pacific remains the dominant source of chub mackerel, with Japan, China, and Russia as primary fishing nations, creating concentrated supply that is vulnerable to stock fluctuations and management decisions.

2. **Processing intermediation**: China's role as a processing hub means that raw material imports and processed product exports may follow different patterns, with value addition occurring in China before products reach final markets.

3. **Demand diversification**: Multiple consuming markets (Japan, South Korea, China, and others) create diversified demand that can absorb supply fluctuations but also transmit demand shocks across borders.

4. **Trade policy sensitivity**: Recent examples including China's ban on Japanese seafood and sanctions affecting Russian imports demonstrate how trade policies can rapidly restructure market relationships.

### 2.4 Regulatory Frameworks and Trade Policy Implications

The regulatory environment governing seafood trade in the Pacific Rim significantly influences market access, compliance costs, and competitive dynamics for chub mackerel and other species. This section examines key regulatory frameworks and their implications for market participants.

#### NOAA Marine Mammal Protection Act Import Provisions

The United States has implemented significant new import restrictions that will reshape Pacific Rim seafood trade patterns. **NOAA Fisheries has imposed seafood import restrictions on 46 nations**, citing the need for adequate protections to ensure the safety of marine mammals during commercial fishing[^31]. **Beginning January 1, 2026, fish and fish products from foreign fisheries listed on NOAA's List of Foreign Fisheries without a comparability finding will be barred from entering U.S. markets**[^31][^32].

The comparability finding framework categorizes all foreign commercial fisheries that export to the United States as either **exempt (with minimal or no marine mammal bycatch) or export (carrying higher risk of marine mammal bycatch or having insufficient data)**[^31]. By holding foreign fisheries to the same rigorous standards as U.S. harvesters, NOAA Fisheries aims to protect marine mammals, uphold the integrity of American seafood, and create a level playing field for U.S. fishermen[^31].

**NOAA Fisheries issued full comparability findings for 89 nations and partial findings for fisheries in 34 nations, while denying comparability for fisheries in 12 nations**[^31]. The 12 nations denied comparability for all of their fisheries include **Benin, Grenada, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Namibia, New Caledonia, Russia, Saint Lucia, The Gambia, Togo, and Venezuela**[^31][^32].

Critically for Pacific Rim trade, **nations denied comparability findings for a subset of their fisheries include several major Pacific Rim exporters**: Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam[^31][^32]. This partial denial creates complex compliance requirements where some fisheries from these nations may continue exporting while others face import prohibitions.

The implications for chub mackerel trade are significant. **Fish and fish products from fisheries denied a comparability finding will be prohibited from import into the United States beginning January 1, 2026**[^32]. Products not subject to a prohibition but sharing a Country of Origin and Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) Code with a prohibited product are subject to **Certification of Admissibility requirements**[^32].

**NOAA Fisheries mapped out prohibited fisheries by each nation, target species and associated HTS codes, fishing area, and fishing gear**[^32]. This detailed mapping creates specific compliance requirements that exporters must navigate to maintain U.S. market access.

#### Country-Specific Export Certification Requirements

Export requirements for seafood products vary significantly across Pacific Rim destination markets, creating differentiated compliance burdens for exporters.

**Australia** maintains particularly stringent requirements. The country requires **several unique Export Health Certificates depending on the fishery product type and presentation**[^33]. Effective February 16, 2026, **Australia requires an FDA Certificate to a Foreign Government (CFG) for exports of bivalve molluscs and bivalve mollusc products from the United States**; NOAA SIP certification alone will not satisfy Australian import requirements[^33]. Australia maintains **specific tolerances for metals and contaminants**, including Mercury (0.5 ppm for fish, crustaceans, molluscs), Lead (1.5 ppm for other fish, 2.5 ppm for canned fish and molluscs), and Cadmium (0.2 ppm for fish, 2.0 ppm for molluscs)[^33].

**Canada** requires that wild marine fish and seafood products for human consumption must **originate from the U.S. or a country approved to export that product directly to Canada**, as listed in the Automated Import Reference System (AIRS)[^33]. NOAA-SIP issues aquatic animal health certificates for specific exports, with certification focusing on aquatic animal health to protect Canada's resources rather than food safety[^33].

**China** maintains comprehensive requirements for seafood imports. **All processors of fishery products for export must be from a USDC SIP Approved Establishment**[^33]. All consignments require either a USDC SIP Lot inspection or production under a USDC NOAA EMP, plus a USDC SIP Export Health certificate[^33]. **Importers must be registered on the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) approved list**[^33].

For fish meal, fish oil, and other aquatic animal proteins used as feed, **facilities must be registered with GACC and be NOAA SIP Approved Establishments for Fishery By-products**, meeting specific hygiene and quarantine requirements including heat treatment and laboratory testing for contaminants and microbiological criteria[^33]. China maintains **specific tolerances for seafood including Mercury (1.0 ppm for carnivores, 0.5 ppm for other fish) and Lead (0.5 ppm)**[^33].

#### Quota Management and Catch Limits

Regulatory frameworks governing catch limits directly affect supply availability and market dynamics. In the North Atlantic, **coastal states have set a joint quota for mackerel at 739,386 tonnes for 2024, a decrease from 782,066 tonnes set for 2023**[^19]. The **International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) recommended a 2% reduction in North Atlantic mackerel quotas for 2023**, which could result in **actual catches plunging 30% below 2022 levels**[^18].

For chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific, the **NPFC Conservation and Management Measure (CMM 2024-07) sets a catch limit of 100,000 metric tonnes** in the Convention Area for each of the 2024 and 2025 fishing seasons. The most recent measure (CMM 2025-07) specifies that the **annual total allowable catch in the Convention Area is 66,740 tonnes**, with trawl vessels limited to 7,940 tonnes and purse seine vessels limited to 58,800 tonnes per 2025 fishing season.

#### Impact of Regulatory Compliance on Market Structure

The cumulative effect of regulatory requirements creates significant compliance costs that influence market structure and competitive dynamics. Smaller exporters may face disproportionate burdens in meeting certification requirements, potentially concentrating trade among larger, better-resourced firms. The **requirement for Certification of Admissibility** for products sharing HTS codes with prohibited fisheries creates additional documentation burdens even for compliant fisheries[^32].

The regulatory environment also creates market segmentation, with different compliance requirements for human consumption versus feed/industrial uses. This segmentation affects the competitive positioning of chub mackerel, which serves both markets, and may influence the allocation of catches between direct consumption and fishmeal production.

### 2.5 Consumption Patterns and Demand Drivers

Understanding seafood consumption patterns across Pacific Rim nations is essential for analyzing demand-side factors influencing chub mackerel markets. This section examines per capita consumption levels, species preferences, and evolving consumer behaviors that shape market demand.

#### Contrasting Consumption Trajectories Across Major Markets

Pacific Rim nations exhibit markedly different trajectories in seafood consumption, reflecting diverse cultural traditions, economic development patterns, and dietary preferences.

**Japan** presents a case of declining seafood consumption from historically high levels. **Annual per capita consumption of fish and shellfish (net food base) has been on a decreasing trend after peaking at 40.2 kg in FY2001**[^25][^34]. The figure for **FY2023 was 21.4 kg (estimate)**[^25], representing a decline of nearly 50% from the peak. **Per capita seafood consumption has hovered below annual per capita meat consumption since FY2011**[^25][^34], marking a significant dietary shift in a country traditionally associated with high seafood consumption.

In 2023, **annual per capita purchase volume of fresh fish and shellfish declined by 4%** from the previous year[^34]. Partly due to the impact of increased prices of fish and fishery product imports, the **Consumer Price Index for fresh fish and shellfish increased by 9%** from the previous year[^34]. **Factors discouraging consumers from purchasing fish and shellfish include high prices and the time and effort needed for preparation**[^25][^34]. Consumer preferences are shifting, with **a growing trend toward simplicity and convenience in food consumption**[^25].

This contrasts sharply with global trends. **The world's annual per capita consumption of fish and shellfish as food has increased, whereas Japan's annual per capita consumption has been on a declining trend**[^25]. While fishery catches have remained flat globally, **aquaculture production has been significantly increasing**[^25].

**South Korea** maintains exceptionally high seafood consumption levels. **Korean annual per capita seafood consumption has been steady over the last decade, remaining much higher than the world average of around 20 kilograms**[^27]. In 2024, **estimated annual per capita consumption was 60.0 kg**, comprised of **34.8 kg of fish and shellfish and 25.2 kg of seaweed**[^27]. This positions Korea among the highest seafood-consuming nations globally.

However, even Korea shows signs of consumption moderation. **While global seafood consumption is increasing, Korea's seafood consumption has been gradually slowing since its peak in 2019**[^27]. **Consumption between 2020 and 2023 has declined across all age groups except those aged 60 and older**[^27]. Notably, **meat consumption more steadily increased during the same period, surpassing seafood in terms of annual per capita consumption volume for the first time in 2022**[^27].

Fish is a staple in the Korean diet, with per capita consumption at **57 kg per year** according to FAO country profile data[^26]. The decline in marine fish production in recent decades has resulted in increased imports, especially from China, with **imports accounting for about 60% of the fish consumed in the country**[^26].

**The United States** demonstrates gradually increasing seafood consumption. **U.S. residents consumed an average of 20.5 pounds (approximately 9.3 kg) of seafood per capita in 2021**[^35]. Over the last three decades, **per capita seafood consumption grew 30%**, led by fresh and frozen seafood[^35]. However, **in 2022, US per capita consumption declined 3.4% to 19.8 pounds from 20.5 pounds in 2021**[^36], and NOAA data indicates **19.7 pounds per capita consumption in 2022**[^37].

The composition of U.S. seafood consumption has shifted significantly. **Growth in fresh and frozen seafood consumption per capita climbed from about 63% of total consumption in 1990 to almost 80% in 2021**[^35]. In contrast, **per capita consumption of canned seafood declined from a 35% share in 1990 to an 18% share in 2021**[^35]. Cured seafood consumption remained constant throughout the period.

A critical characteristic of the U.S. market is import dependence: **about 80% of all seafood consumed in the United States is estimated to come from imported products**[^35].

The following table summarizes per capita seafood consumption across major Pacific Rim markets:

| Country | Per Capita Consumption | Trend | Key Characteristics |
|---------|----------------------|-------|---------------------|
| **South Korea** | 60.0 kg (2024) | Gradually declining since 2019 peak | Highest in region; includes 25.2 kg seaweed |
| **Japan** | 21.4 kg (FY2023) | Declining from 40.2 kg peak (2001) | Below meat consumption since 2011 |
| **United States** | 19.7 lbs/8.9 kg (2022) | Gradually increasing over 30 years | 80% from imports |
| **China** | 15.2 kg (2023) | Increasing from 3.5 kg (1978) | World's largest consumer by volume |

#### Species Preferences and Mackerel's Market Position

Mackerel holds a significant position in the consumption preferences of several Pacific Rim markets. **The major seafood species consumed in South Korea include mackerel, squid, Alaska pollack, shrimp, flat fish, hairtail, crabs, monkfish, eels, anchovy, oyster, and octopus**[^27][^30]. Mackerel's prominence in this list reflects its cultural significance and affordability in the Korean market.

In Japan, **mackerel, yellowtail fish, and tuna** are identified among the fish species that have become staples in Japanese kitchens[^38]. Japanese cuisine incorporates a wide selection of sea life, with salmon and trout being consumers' favorite types of seafood for applications ranging from sushi to traditional meals[^38]. However, mackerel maintains traditional importance, particularly for processed and preserved preparations.

Korean consumers' seafood purchasing patterns are **rapidly shifting toward convenience**. **Purchases of raw seafood (to be prepared at home) are declining, while demand for processed seafood products and home meal replacement (HMR) products that incorporate seafood ingredients are rapidly growing**[^27]. This trend has implications for mackerel, which can be processed into various convenient product forms.

According to Mintel's Global New Products Database, **there were 5,090 new food products containing fish and fish product ingredients launched in South Korea from January 2019 to December 2024**[^30]. The predominant sub-categories included **fish products (1,532 products), meal kits (760 products), prepared meals (434 products), wet soup (290 products), and meat snacks (266 products)**[^30]. The most popular product claims were **ease of use (1,177 products), microwaveable (1,092 products), and premium claims (607 products)**[^30].

#### Demand Drivers and Consumption Barriers

Several factors drive seafood demand across Pacific Rim markets:

**Health perceptions** play a significant role. Fish and shellfish are **cherished as a seasonal ingredient with better health-promoting effects compared to meat** in Japan[^38]. However, concerns about **methylmercury content** in mackerel products represent a potential demand constraint[^18].

**Price sensitivity** significantly affects consumption patterns. In Japan, **high prices are identified as a key factor discouraging consumers from purchasing fish and shellfish**[^25][^34]. The 9% increase in the Consumer Price Index for fresh fish and shellfish in 2023 contributed to declining purchase volumes[^34].

**Convenience orientation** is increasingly important. The **time and effort required for cooking** fish is identified as a barrier to consumption in Japan[^25][^34]. Consumer preferences are shifting toward **simplification and convenience in eating**[^25][^34]. This trend favors processed and ready-to-eat seafood products over whole fresh fish.

**Cultural exchange and dietary diversification** affect consumption patterns. In Japan, **cultural exchange has introduced numerous meat-based dishes that have found widespread popularity among consumers**[^38]. Rising meat consumption has been contrasting seafood consumption, with **wide accessibility and simple preparation working in favor of meat**[^38].

**Demographic factors** influence consumption trajectories. In South Korea, **consumption between 2020 and 2023 declined across all age groups except those aged 60 and older**[^27], suggesting generational differences in seafood preferences.

#### Government Initiatives to Promote Seafood Consumption

In response to declining consumption trends, government agencies have implemented promotional initiatives. **Japan's Fisheries Agency has designated the 3rd to the 7th of each month as "Sakana no Hi" (Fish Day)** to promote public and private initiatives aimed at increasing fish and shellfish consumption[^25][^34]. The Agency supports the **development of highly convenient products and the establishment of value chains** based on cooperation among production, processing, distribution, and sale parties[^34]. To establish fish-eating habits from an early age, **creating opportunities for familiarity through school lunches and promoting local production for local consumption** are emphasized[^34].

### 2.6 Competitive Positioning of Chub Mackerel in Regional Markets

This section synthesizes the preceding analyses to assess chub mackerel's competitive position within Pacific Rim seafood markets, examining competition with alternative protein sources, market segmentation by product form, and the species' dual role in human consumption and industrial applications.

#### Competition with Alternative Protein Sources

Chub mackerel competes in a complex marketplace against both other seafood species and terrestrial protein sources. The competitive dynamics vary across markets and product segments.

**Within the mackerel category**, chub mackerel faces competition from Atlantic mackerel (*Scomber scombrus*) and other mackerel species. Atlantic mackerel held **38.18% of the global mackerel market share in 2024**[^18], positioning it as the dominant species by market value despite chub mackerel's larger catch volumes (1.9 million tonnes versus 1.1 million tonnes in 2022)[^19]. The premium placed on Atlantic mackerel, particularly Norwegian autumn mackerel with its higher fat content, creates price differentiation within the mackerel category.

**Against other small pelagic species**, chub mackerel competes with sardines, anchovies, and jack mackerel. In the Ecuadorian small pelagic fishery, Pacific chub mackerel is targeted alongside frigate tuna and other species using purse seines[^17]. The fishery's overall rating of "Yellow (Good Alternative)" for Pacific chub mackerel reflects sustainability considerations that increasingly influence market access and consumer preferences[^17].

**Against terrestrial proteins**, seafood generally faces competitive pressure from meat products. In Japan, **per capita seafood consumption has hovered below meat consumption since FY2011**[^25][^34]. In South Korea, **meat consumption surpassed seafood in terms of annual per capita consumption volume for the first time in 2022**[^27]. These trends suggest that mackerel and other seafood species face structural competitive challenges from meat products, particularly among younger consumers.

The competitive positioning of chub mackerel is influenced by its **affordability relative to other protein sources**. Market drivers include **surging demand for affordable oceanic protein** and **growth in canned seafood consumption across emerging Asia**[^18], both of which favor lower-priced species like chub mackerel.

#### Dual Market Role: Human Consumption and Fishmeal Production

Chub mackerel serves both direct human consumption and industrial applications, creating distinct market segments with different demand drivers and price dynamics.

**For human consumption**, chub mackerel is sold fresh, frozen, and in various processed forms. In Japan, mackerel is a staple species consumed in traditional preparations. In South Korea, mackerel ranks among the major seafood species consumed, benefiting from the shift toward convenient processed products[^27][^30]. The **U.S. market imported approximately 18,000 MT of mackerel in 2022**, including about 1,200 MT from Ecuador[^17].

**For fishmeal production**, chub mackerel contributes to the feed ingredient market supporting aquaculture growth. In Ecuador, **Pacific chub mackerel is mostly used to produce fishmeal**[^17], reflecting the species' role in industrial applications. The **fishery by-products market is projected to grow from USD 26.34 billion in 2025 to USD 37.46 billion by 2030**[^20], indicating expanding demand for fishmeal and related products.

The dual-use nature of chub mackerel creates market segmentation that affects pricing dynamics. When fishmeal prices rise due to constraints on anchoveta supply (as occurred during El Niño impacts on Peruvian fisheries), the opportunity cost of directing chub mackerel to human consumption increases. Conversely, when human consumption markets offer premium prices, catches may shift away from reduction uses.

**China's restrained demand for fishmeal** (imports declining 9% to 1,650,000 tonnes in 2023)[^19] and **Ecuador's reduced fishmeal imports** (declining from 73,000 tonnes in 2022 to 50,000 tonnes in 2023)[^19] suggest that industrial demand for small pelagics has moderated, potentially affecting the allocation of chub mackerel catches between market segments.

#### Market Segmentation by Product Form

The mackerel market is segmented by product form, with distinct characteristics for fresh/frozen, canned, and processed products.

**Fresh and frozen products** dominate the U.S. market, with **fresh and frozen seafood consumption per capita climbing from about 63% of total consumption in 1990 to almost 80% in 2021**[^35]. This trend favors higher-quality, minimally processed mackerel products.

**Canned products** have declined in relative importance in developed markets but remain significant in emerging markets. **Per capita consumption of canned seafood in the U.S. declined from a 35% share in 1990 to an 18% share in 2021**[^35]. However, the **"tinned fish" craze** has shown recent increases in consumption of canned tuna, canned shellfish, and canned sardines[^39], potentially benefiting canned mackerel products.

**Processed and value-added products** represent a growing segment, particularly in markets with strong convenience orientation. South Korea's **rapidly growing demand for processed seafood products and home meal replacement (HMR) products**[^27] creates opportunities for mackerel-based convenience foods.

**Retail market scale** varies across Pacific Rim markets. **South Korea was the fourteenth largest global market for fresh fish and seafood with retail sales of USD 4.9 billion in 2024**[^30], with fish representing the largest category at USD 2.7 billion (55.1% market share)[^30]. The country was the **sixteenth largest global market for processed seafood with retail sales of USD 989.5 million in 2024**, expected to grow at 1.6% annually to USD 1.1 billion by 2029[^30].

#### Sustainability Considerations and Market Access

Sustainability assessments increasingly influence market access and competitive positioning for chub mackerel. The **Seafood Watch assessment** provides ratings that affect procurement decisions by retailers and food service operators.

For Pacific chub mackerel from the Ecuadorian fishery, the **overall rating is "Yellow (Good Alternative)"**[^17]. The 2023 stock assessment indicated that **biomass is above target reference points**, but **fishing mortality levels were too high**, estimated at 17% above the recommended level with an overfishing risk of 66%[^17]. The population reduction by 2022 was estimated at close to the target, around **36% of virgin biomass (B0)**, with the management target being ≥40% B0[^17].

The fishery operates under a **Fishery Management Plan (FMP) that aims to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2025**[^17]. Management measures include a **bycatch ceiling of 20% in biomass, a mandatory observer program covering at least 30% of the fleet, annual closures, spatial and temporal closures, and mandatory use of vessel monitoring systems (VMS)**[^17].

For Japanese fisheries, Seafood Watch assessments provide specific ratings for different stocks and gear types. The **Tsushima Warm Current stock caught with purse seines received a "Good Alternative" rating** with catch volume of 85,647 metric tons[^40]. The **Pacific Coast of Japan stock caught with purse seines also received a "Good Alternative" rating** with catch volume of 185,712 metric tons[^40]. However, the **Tsushima Warm Current stock caught with stationary uncovered pound nets received an "Avoid" rating** with catch volume of 5,561 metric tons in 2020[^40].

Stock assessment findings indicate that **fishing mortality is above a sustainable level for the Tsushima Warm Current stock**, while **both biomass and fishing mortality are at sustainable levels for the Pacific stock**[^40]. These differential sustainability ratings create market segmentation based on sourcing, with implications for supply chain traceability and certification requirements.

#### Market Opportunities and Constraints

The analysis reveals several key opportunities and constraints shaping chub mackerel's competitive position:

**Opportunities:**
- Growing demand for affordable oceanic protein in emerging Asian markets[^18]
- Expanding aquaculture sector requiring fishmeal inputs[^20]
- Shift toward convenient processed seafood products in developed markets[^27][^30]
- High per capita seafood consumption in key markets like South Korea[^27]

**Constraints:**
- Declining seafood consumption trends in Japan[^25][^34]
- Competition from meat products, particularly among younger consumers[^27][^38]
- Regulatory compliance costs for export markets[^33][^31][^32]
- Sustainability concerns affecting certain stocks and gear types[^17][^40]
- Supply volatility due to stock fluctuations and climate impacts[^18]

The integration of these factors establishes the market context for subsequent chapters analyzing price dynamics and oceanographic linkages. Understanding the structural characteristics of Pacific Rim seafood markets—including market scale, trade flows, regulatory frameworks, and consumption patterns—is essential for interpreting how biological and environmental factors translate into economic outcomes for chub mackerel fisheries.

## 3 Price Dynamics of Chub Mackerel in Pacific Rim Markets

This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of chub mackerel price formation, volatility, and trends across major Pacific Rim markets including Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, and Peru. Building upon the market landscape established in Chapter 2, this chapter examines how supply-side factors (catch volumes, stock conditions, fishing effort), demand-side drivers (consumption patterns, processing industry requirements, substitute species competition), trade policies (tariffs, import bans, quota management), and currency fluctuations collectively shape price dynamics. The analysis integrates historical price data with contemporary market developments to identify seasonal patterns, interannual volatility characteristics, and the transmission mechanisms through which biological and oceanographic factors translate into market price signals. Understanding these price dynamics is essential for establishing the correlations between marine biological variations and economic outcomes that form the central thesis of this research.

### 3.1 Historical Price Trends and Long-Term Market Evolution

The long-term evolution of chub mackerel prices across Pacific Rim markets reveals a complex interplay of supply constraints, demand shifts, and structural market changes that have fundamentally altered the species' economic positioning over the past several decades. This section establishes baseline price trajectories and identifies the structural shifts that have transformed chub mackerel from an affordable staple protein into an increasingly premium-priced commodity in key Asian markets.

#### Global Fish Price Index Context and Mackerel Market Positioning

The broader context for chub mackerel price evolution is captured by the **FAO Fish Price Index (FPI)**, which serves as a key barometer of world fish market conditions. The FPI tracks monthly changes in international prices of fisheries and aquaculture commodities, averaging 15 price series across five key species groups—pelagic, salmon, shrimp, tuna, and whitefish—weighted by export values from the base period 2014-2016[^41].

The trajectory of the FAO Fish Price Index demonstrates the structural price pressures affecting pelagic species including chub mackerel:

| Year | FAO Fish Price Index (Points) | Annual Trend |
|------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| 2022 | 119 | Record high |
| 2023 | 117 | Moderate decline |
| 2024 | 114 | Continued decline, recovery signs late year |
| 2025 (Jan-Nov) | 117 | Upward trend |

The index **peaked at a record high of 119 points in 2022**, followed by a moderate decline to 117 points in 2023 and further to 114 points in 2024, with signs of recovery appearing toward the end of 2024[^41]. Over the first eleven months of 2025, the index averaged 117 points, indicating an upward trend compared with 2024[^41]. This recovery trajectory is particularly significant for pelagic fish prices, which showed **a 15.0 percent year-on-year increase in November 2025 compared with November 2024**, despite a 3.3 percent monthly decrease from October 2025[^41].

The global mackerel market's valuation reflects this price appreciation. **The Global Mackerel Market size was valued at USD 1,150.00 million in 2018, growing to USD 1,328.67 million in 2024, and is anticipated to reach USD 1,987.36 million by 2032**, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.21% during the forecast period[^42]. Alternative market assessments project even larger valuations, with the global mackerel market estimated to grow from **USD 13.48 billion in 2025 to USD 17.45 billion by 2030**, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.31%[^43]. These divergent valuations reflect different methodological approaches but consistently indicate robust long-term growth driven by increasing consumer demand for affordable protein-rich seafood.

#### Japanese Wholesale Market Price Evolution

Japan's wholesale market provides the most comprehensive longitudinal price data for chub mackerel in the Pacific Rim. **The average wholesale price for mackerel was 560 yen per kilogram at Tokyo's Central Wholesale Market in 2024, representing an increase of approximately 30 percent from five years earlier**[^44]. This sustained price appreciation reflects the fundamental supply-demand imbalance that has characterized the Japanese mackerel market over the past decade.

The price trajectory in Japan is directly linked to declining domestic catches. According to the Fisheries Agency, **Japan's mackerel catch was approximately 271,000 tons in fiscal 2023 (from July 2023 to June 2024), a figure that has almost halved over the past five years**[^44]. This catch decline represents one of the most significant supply contractions in the species' commercial history, with profound implications for price formation.

The relationship between catch volumes and prices in Japan demonstrates the classic inverse correlation characteristic of commodity markets under supply constraints. Historical catch data from Japanese fisheries shows dramatic fluctuations over the past several decades:

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Japanese Chub Mackerel Catch Trends (Fishing Year Basis)"
    x-axis [FY2018, FY2019, FY2020, FY2021, FY2022, FY2023]
    y-axis "Catch (thousand tons)" 0 --> 350
    bar [330, 280, 250, 200, 98.5, 31.2]
```

The data reveals a **substantial decline in FY2022 to only 98,500 tons**, followed by even lower catches in FY2023 (31,200 tons as of November 2023)[^45]. This represents a collapse from historical levels exceeding 300,000 tons annually, creating the supply scarcity that has driven wholesale prices upward.

Japanese import prices for mackerel have followed a corresponding upward trajectory. **The average price for frozen mackerel imported to Japan was 2.57K USD per ton in 2024, increasing to 3K USD per ton in the first eight months of 2025, representing a 21.46% growth compared to the previous year**[^43]. This price surge, despite only modest volume increases, suggests strong demand-side pressures combined with supply constraints that have fundamentally altered the market equilibrium.

Export price data for Japanese mackerel shows even more dramatic appreciation. **Japan's mackerel export prices rose from a range of USD 7.50-36.00 per kilogram in 2023 to USD 16.67-38.46 per kilogram in 2024**, representing substantial increases at both the lower and upper ends of the price spectrum[^46]. This export price appreciation reflects both domestic supply scarcity and strong international demand for Japanese-origin mackerel.

#### South Korean Market Price Dynamics

South Korea presents a particularly instructive case study in mackerel price dynamics due to the species' cultural significance as a "national fish" and the market's heavy reliance on imports to meet domestic demand. Recent price developments have been dramatic.

**According to a December 2025 Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation report, the retail price of a pair of imported salted (large) mackerel averaged 10,363 Korean won in December 2025, surpassing 10,000 Korean won for the first time**[^47]. This price level represents:
- An increase of more than 500 Korean won from November 2025 (9,828 Korean won)
- A **28.8% increase compared to one year earlier** (8,048 Korean won)
- **More than double the price from two years earlier** (6,804 Korean won)

The sustained nature of this price appreciation is evident from daily price tracking: **the price of imported mackerel rose to the 10,000 Korean won range at 10,129 Korean won on November 24, 2025, and remained above 10,000 Korean won daily throughout December, continuing to rise to 10,836 Korean won as of December 31, 2025**[^47].

Domestic mackerel prices in South Korea have also appreciated significantly. **The average annual price of domestic fresh chilled (large) mackerel in 2025 was 4,689 Korean won, representing a 16.9% increase from the previous year's 4,012 Korean won**[^47]. Earlier in 2025, domestic retail prices showed even more dramatic year-on-year increases, with **retail prices per mackerel (domestic saline and medium products) reaching 6,720 won as of mid-2025, up 34.6% from the previous year (4,993 won) and 65.2% from the average year (4,069 won)**[^48].

Import price data reveals the international supply-side pressures driving Korean market prices. **According to the Korea Maritime Institute, the import price of mackerel per kilogram jumped to $5.2 in November 2025, doubling from a year earlier ($2.6)**[^47]. This 100% year-on-year increase in import unit values represents one of the most significant price shocks in the Korean mackerel market's recent history.

#### Historical Volatility Patterns and Structural Market Shifts

The long-term price evolution across Pacific Rim markets reveals several structural shifts that have fundamentally altered chub mackerel's market positioning:

**First**, the species has transitioned from a low-cost commodity to an increasingly premium-priced product. This shift reflects both absolute supply constraints (declining catches) and relative supply changes (reduced proportion of preferred size classes). The doubling of Korean import prices within a single year and the 30% increase in Japanese wholesale prices over five years demonstrate the magnitude of this structural repricing.

**Second**, price volatility has increased substantially. The historical data from Peru provides context for understanding the species' inherent price variability: **Peru retail prices for mackerel ranged from a record low of 3.470 PEN/kg in February 1995 to an all-time high of 15.180 PEN/kg in October 2013**, with a median of 7.905 PEN/kg over the 1995-2018 period[^49]. This four-fold range between historical minimum and maximum prices illustrates the substantial volatility characteristic of small pelagic fish markets.

**Third**, the relationship between global and regional price dynamics has strengthened as markets have become more integrated through trade. Norwegian mackerel exports now directly influence Korean retail prices, while Japanese domestic catches affect export prices throughout the region. This integration means that supply disruptions in one market rapidly transmit price effects across the Pacific Rim.

### 3.2 Seasonal Price Patterns and Intra-Annual Volatility

Seasonal price patterns in chub mackerel markets reflect the fundamental biological rhythms of the species—spawning cycles, migration patterns, and the associated fishing seasons that concentrate catches in specific periods. Understanding these intra-annual patterns is essential for interpreting price signals and distinguishing seasonal fluctuations from longer-term structural changes.

#### Fishing Season Timing and Catch Concentration

The temporal distribution of chub mackerel catches creates predictable seasonal supply variations that directly influence price formation. In Japan, **substantial catches typically occur between November and spring months**, with November historically being a particularly important month for landings[^45]. However, recent years have shown departures from this pattern, with **FY2023 showing notably low November catches compared to historical norms**[^45].

The monthly catch distribution in Japan demonstrates this seasonal concentration:

| Month | Typical Catch Pattern | Price Implications |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| July-September | Low (post-spawning recovery) | Higher prices |
| October | Building | Moderate prices |
| November | Peak (historically high) | Price pressure downward |
| December-March | Sustained high | Stable to declining prices |
| April-June | Declining (pre-spawning) | Rising prices |

This seasonal pattern creates corresponding price cycles, with prices typically elevated during periods of low catch (summer months) and depressed during peak fishing seasons (late autumn through winter). However, **the FY2022-2023 period showed anomalous patterns**, with catches remaining low throughout the year due to oceanographic factors including the northward insertion of the Kuroshio extension that kept fish away from main fishing grounds[^45].

Research on optimal harvest strategies for chub mackerel in South Korea has formalized the relationship between catch timing and price dynamics. Studies have demonstrated that **large catches of mackerel tend to correlate with lower prices**, making it crucial to develop harvest strategies that account for this catch-dependent pricing[^50]. The research defined logarithmic, rational, and irrational catch-dependent price functions to model these relationships, finding that **optimal harvest strategies vary depending on the price function assumed**[^50].

Under constant price assumptions, **fishing effort optimally increases immediately after spawning and then gradually decreases**. However, under logarithmic price functions that better capture market realities, **optimal fishing effort involves a gradual increase from July immediately after the spawning period, with maximum effort in June before the next spawning season**[^50]. This finding has important implications for understanding how management decisions regarding closed seasons affect both resource sustainability and market price dynamics.

#### Closed Season Effects on Price Formation

The timing of closed seasons significantly affects supply availability and price levels. Research comparing the effects of monthly closed seasons across different pricing scenarios found that **a closed season in July immediately after spawning provides the highest resource recovery efficiency**, while **a closed season in June provides the highest catch and profit efficiencies**[^50]. This trade-off between biological sustainability and economic optimization illustrates the complex relationship between management interventions and market outcomes.

Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has established **Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits for 15 species including mackerel**. The TAC for mackerel was set at:
- 145,905 metric tons for July 2022 to June 2023
- 126,072 metric tons for July 2023 to June 2024
- 122,993 metric tons for both July 2024 to June 2025 and July 2025 to June 2026[^27]

The progressive reduction in TAC limits reflects concerns about stock sustainability and directly constrains supply availability, contributing to the sustained price appreciation observed in Korean markets.

#### Taiwan Wholesale Price Volatility as Seasonal Indicator

Taiwan wholesale market data provides particularly striking evidence of seasonal price amplitude in chub mackerel markets. **Taiwan wholesale prices for mackerel demonstrated extreme monthly volatility, ranging from a record low of 9.900 NTD/kg in April 2003 to an all-time high of 57.500 NTD/kg in June 2018**[^51]. This nearly six-fold range between minimum and maximum monthly prices illustrates the substantial intra-annual volatility characteristic of the species.

The monthly price trajectory in 2018 demonstrates this volatility:
- April 2018: 24.80 NTD/kg
- May 2018: 30.60 NTD/kg
- June 2018: 57.50 NTD/kg (all-time high)
- July 2018: 23.90 NTD/kg[^51]

This pattern shows prices more than doubling from May to June, then collapsing by more than 50% from June to July. Such extreme monthly fluctuations reflect the combined effects of seasonal catch patterns, inventory dynamics, and demand variations associated with festivals and consumption occasions.

The **median wholesale price of 23.500 NTD/kg over the 2003-2018 period** provides a baseline against which to assess seasonal deviations[^51]. Prices substantially above this median typically occur during periods of supply scarcity (pre-spawning, post-spawning recovery), while prices below the median characterize periods of abundant supply.

#### Quality Differentiation and Seasonal Premiums

Seasonal price patterns are further complicated by quality differentiation related to fish condition. **Norwegian autumn mackerel, known in Japan as "Saba Nouveau," commands premium prices due to fat content approximately twice that of local stocks**. This quality differentiation creates a distinct market segment where seasonal timing directly affects product value through its influence on fish physiological condition.

The biological basis for this quality premium relates to the capital breeding strategy documented for chub mackerel. Fish accumulate lipid reserves during feeding periods (late summer through autumn) that are subsequently depleted during spawning. The timing of harvest relative to this physiological cycle determines the fat content and thus the market value of the product.

This quality-timing relationship has implications for understanding price dynamics:

```mermaid

    subgraph Biology["Biological Cycle"]
        A[Spring Spawning] --> B[Summer Feeding]
        B --> C[Autumn Fat Accumulation]

    end
    
    subgraph Price["Price Premium"]
        E --> G[Premium Pricing]
        F --> H[Standard Pricing]
    end
```

The seasonal quality cycle creates opportunities for market differentiation that transcend simple supply-demand dynamics, with premium autumn-caught mackerel commanding prices substantially above those for spring-caught fish of equivalent size.

### 3.3 Supply-Side Price Determinants: Catch Volumes and Stock Conditions

The fundamental driver of chub mackerel price dynamics across Pacific Rim markets is the relationship between supply availability—determined by catch volumes and stock conditions—and market demand. This section examines how declining catches, deteriorating stock status, and changes in size composition have created the supply constraints that underpin recent price appreciation.

#### Inverse Relationship Between Catch Quantity and Price

Economic theory predicts an inverse relationship between commodity supply and price, and chub mackerel markets conform closely to this expectation. Research on South Korean mackerel markets has formally documented this relationship, demonstrating that **large catches of mackerel tend to have lower prices**[^50]. This catch-dependent pricing creates important dynamics for understanding market behavior.

The mathematical relationship between catch and price has been modeled using various functional forms:
- **Logarithmic price functions**: Capture the diminishing marginal price impact of additional catch
- **Rational price functions**: Model price as a declining function of catch with bounded behavior
- **Irrational price functions**: Allow for more extreme price responses to supply changes

These models demonstrate that **optimal harvest strategies differ significantly depending on which price function is assumed**, highlighting the importance of understanding catch-price relationships for both fisheries management and market forecasting[^50].

#### Japan's Catch Decline and Price Consequences

Japan provides the clearest example of how catch declines translate into price increases. The magnitude of Japan's catch decline is striking:

| Period | Catch Volume | Change |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Historical peak (1978) | 1.47 million tons | Baseline |
| Five years ago | ~500,000 tons | -66% from peak |
| FY2023 | 271,000 tons | -46% from five years ago |
| FY2022 purse seine catch | 98,500 tons | 30-year low |

**Japan's mackerel catch was approximately 271,000 tons in fiscal 2023, a figure that has almost halved over the past five years**[^44]. The **FY2022 purse seine catch of 98,500 tons represented the lowest level in 30 years**, with preliminary FY2023 data showing even lower catches of only 31,200 tons through November 2023[^45].

This catch collapse has directly driven price appreciation. **The average wholesale price at Tokyo's Central Wholesale Market increased approximately 30% from five years earlier to 560 yen/kg in 2024**[^44]. The **purchase price of mackerel for canned products has doubled over the past three years**, according to industry representatives[^44].

The production consequences of this supply constraint are evident in the canned mackerel industry. **Canned mackerel production in Japan has declined by 50 percent over the past five years**, with production totaling only 21,000 tons in 2024, representing a 7% year-on-year decrease[^44]. At one major processor, **canned mackerel production is now one-thirtieth the volume from 10 years ago**[^44]. These production declines reflect the inability of processors to secure raw material at economically viable prices.

#### Stock Assessment Outcomes and Forward-Looking Price Pressures

Stock assessment outcomes provide forward-looking indicators of supply availability that influence price expectations. Japanese stock assessments have documented concerning conditions for major chub mackerel stocks.

**For 50 stocks of 36 fisheries species, stock assessments were made with three levels of stock condition: high, medium, and low. The stock condition for Chub mackerel (Pacific) and Chub mackerel (Tsushima warm current) was assessed as low in FY2022**[^52]. This "low" assessment indicates that current biomass levels are below target reference points, creating expectations of continued supply constraints.

The broader context of Japanese fisheries management shows expanding stock assessment coverage. Under the new Fishery Act enforced in December 2020, **the number of fisheries species subject to stock assessment was expanded from 119 to 192 in FY2021**, with **the number of species subject to MSY-based management targets expanded from 26 stocks of 17 species to 38 stocks of 22 species**[^52].

Climate change is identified as a contributing factor to stock condition deterioration. **Climate change affects fisheries resources through rising sea water temperatures, causing a northward shift of the distribution area of Japanese Spanish mackerel and the spawning beds of chub mackerel**[^52]. This distributional shift has important implications for catch accessibility and fishing costs, as fish move away from traditional fishing grounds.

#### NPFC Quota Reductions and Supply Constraints

International management decisions by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) directly constrain supply availability in the Convention Area. The most recent Conservation and Management Measure (CMM 2025-07) specifies that **the annual total allowable catch in the Convention Area is 66,740 tonnes**, with allocations of:
- Trawl vessels: 7,940 tonnes
- Purse seine vessels: 58,800 tonnes

This represents a significant reduction from earlier measures. **The CMM 2024-07 had set a catch limit of 100,000 metric tonnes** in the Convention Area for each of the 2024 and 2025 fishing seasons. The **approximately 33% reduction from 100,000 tonnes to 66,740 tonnes** directly constrains supply availability from high seas fisheries, contributing to price pressures across the region.

#### Critical Importance of Fish Size Composition

Perhaps the most significant supply-side development affecting recent price dynamics is the dramatic change in size composition of catches. South Korean data provides compelling evidence of this phenomenon.

**According to the Korea Maritime Institute, the proportion of medium to large mackerel (over 300g) caught through July 2025 was only 3.6%, a significant decrease from the average year (16.2%)**[^47]. This collapse in the proportion of commercially preferred size classes has profound price implications:

| Size Category | Average Year Proportion | 2025 Proportion | Change |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Medium/Large (>300g) | 16.2% | 3.6% | -78% |
| Small (<300g) | 83.8% | 96.4% | +15% |

**The decrease in catches of medium to large mackerel is analyzed as a result of poor growth and dispersed schools due to high water temperatures**[^47]. This biological explanation links environmental conditions directly to market-relevant quality characteristics.

The market consequence is that **despite domestic mackerel catches in South Korea increasing significantly compared to the previous year (246,165 tons from January to October 2025, a 2.4-fold increase from 102,844 tons in the same period of 2024), prices have risen because the number of medium to large mackerel preferred by Koreans has decreased**[^47]. This paradox—rising prices despite increased total catch—demonstrates that **quantity alone does not determine market value; the size and quality composition of catches is equally important**.

The small mackerels that dominate recent catches are reportedly being exported rather than consumed domestically, as they do not meet Korean consumer preferences for larger fish. This creates a situation where total catch volume provides a misleading indicator of domestic supply availability for the preferred product segment.

### 3.4 Demand-Side Price Drivers: Consumption Shifts and Processing Industry Requirements

While supply constraints have been the primary driver of recent price appreciation, demand-side factors also significantly influence chub mackerel price dynamics. This section examines how consumption patterns, processing industry requirements, and competition for raw materials shape market demand and price formation.

#### Declining Per Capita Consumption in Japan

Japan's declining seafood consumption trend provides important context for understanding mackerel demand dynamics. **Annual per capita consumption of fish and shellfish has been on a decreasing trend from the peak of 40.2 kg in FY2001 to an estimated 23.2 kg in FY2021**[^52]. More recent data indicates **per capita consumption of 21.4 kg in FY2023**, continuing the downward trajectory.

This consumption decline might be expected to reduce demand pressure and moderate prices. However, several factors complicate this relationship:

**First**, the decline in consumption has been accompanied by a shift toward higher-value products. Consumers increasingly prefer convenience-oriented, processed seafood products over whole fresh fish. This shift changes the nature of demand rather than simply reducing it.

**Second**, price increases themselves contribute to consumption decline. **In 2022, partly due to the impact of increased prices of fish and fishery product imports, the Consumer Price Index for fresh fish and shellfish increased by 14% from the previous year, and the annual per-capita purchase volume of fresh fish and shellfish declined by 14%**[^52]. This suggests a price elasticity effect where higher prices reduce quantity demanded, but the relationship is bidirectional—supply constraints drive prices up, which then reduces consumption.

**Third**, demographic factors influence consumption patterns differently across age groups. Younger consumers show stronger preferences for meat over fish, while older consumers maintain traditional seafood consumption habits.

#### Sustained High Consumption in South Korea

South Korea presents a contrasting demand picture, with sustained high per capita seafood consumption creating robust demand for mackerel. **Korean annual per capita seafood consumption remains much higher than the world average**, with mackerel specifically identified among the major seafood species consumed in the country[^27].

The institutional and food service sector represents an important demand segment with distinct characteristics. **The institutional and food service sector generally uses less expensive food ingredients, with the most popular fish products including frozen flatfish, croaker, mackerel (from Norway), Atka mackerel, shrimp, frozen Alaska pollack, and farmed salmon**[^27]. This sector's demand for affordable protein creates a floor for mackerel demand even as retail prices increase.

#### Canned Mackerel Industry Decline and Raw Material Competition

The canned mackerel processing industry represents a significant demand segment that has been severely affected by supply constraints and rising raw material costs. **Canned mackerel production in Japan has declined by 50 percent over the past five years**, with 2024 production totaling only 21,000 tons[^44].

The economics of canned mackerel production have deteriorated dramatically:
- **Purchase price of mackerel for canned products has doubled over the past three years**[^44]
- Production volumes have collapsed at individual processors, with one company reporting **production at one-thirtieth the volume from 10 years ago**[^44]
- **The production of canned fishery products overall hit its lowest level since 1952**, totaling 73,742 tons in 2024, an 84% decrease from the 1980 peak of 465,005 tons[^44]

This industry decline reflects the inability of canned product prices to keep pace with raw material cost increases. When wholesale mackerel prices rise 30% while canned product prices cannot increase proportionally due to consumer price sensitivity, processor margins compress and production becomes uneconomic.

The broader canned seafood industry context shows similar patterns across species:
- Canned saury production decreased approximately 21% year-on-year
- Canned salmon production decreased 16%
- Canned mackerel production decreased 7%
- Canned sardine production declined 17% year-on-year in 2024[^44]

#### Competition Between Human Consumption and Fishmeal Production

Chub mackerel serves both direct human consumption and industrial applications including fishmeal production, creating competition for raw materials that affects price dynamics. In some markets, **a significant portion of Pacific chub mackerel catches is used for fishmeal production**, particularly when fish size or quality does not meet human consumption standards.

The fishmeal market provides an alternative outlet that establishes a floor price for mackerel. When human consumption prices fall below fishmeal equivalent values, catches can be redirected to reduction uses. Conversely, when human consumption markets offer premium prices, catches shift away from fishmeal production.

Peruvian anchovy supplies significantly influence this competitive dynamic. **Peru's anchovy catch in MY 2024/25 is forecasted at 4.9 million metric tons, increasing 29 percent compared to the previous year**[^53]. Improved anchoveta supplies are expected to ease fishmeal market tightness, potentially reducing the opportunity cost of directing mackerel to human consumption.

The average fishmeal price provides context for understanding this competition: **the average fishmeal price in CY2023 was $1,723 per MT, increasing five percent compared to the previous year**[^53]. At these price levels, lower-quality mackerel may be economically directed to reduction rather than human consumption markets.

### 3.5 Trade Policy Impacts and Cross-Border Price Transmission

International trade policies, tariff structures, and geopolitical events create important channels through which price dynamics transmit across Pacific Rim markets. This section examines how trade relationships, particularly Norway's dominant position as a mackerel supplier to Asia, influence price formation in importing countries.

#### Norway's Dominant Role in Asian Mackerel Supply

Norway has established itself as the critical supplier of mackerel to Asian markets, with trade volumes and values that significantly influence regional price dynamics. **Norwegian exporters shipped 313,242 tonnes of mackerel in 2024, generating revenue of 8.3 billion Norwegian kroner (NOK)**, representing a historic high in export value[^43].

The importance of Norwegian mackerel to South Korea is particularly significant. **Most of the mackerel imported by South Korea is Norwegian**, making the Korean market highly sensitive to Norwegian supply conditions and pricing[^47]. **South Korea imported 41,000 tonnes of Norwegian mackerel in 2023, valued at 1 billion Norwegian kroner**.

Norwegian mackerel supply to Asian markets is constrained by quota management decisions. **Norway sets total allowable catches based on recommendations from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)**[^47]. Recent ICES recommendations have significantly reduced available quotas:

| Year | ICES Recommended Quota | Change |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| 2024 | 577,000 tonnes | Baseline |
| 2025 | 174,000 tonnes | -70% |

**The total catch quota recommended by ICES for 2025 is set to decrease by 70% compared to 2024, to only 174,000 tonnes**[^47]. This dramatic quota reduction directly constrains Norwegian export availability and creates upward pressure on prices throughout Asian import markets.

#### Exchange Rate Transmission to Domestic Prices

Currency fluctuations create an additional channel through which international market conditions affect domestic prices. The Korean won's depreciation against the US dollar has amplified the impact of rising import prices on Korean consumers.

**With the recent high exchange rate nearing 1,500 Korean won per USD, prices in won are inevitably rising even more sharply than dollar-denominated import prices**[^47]. This exchange rate effect compounds the impact of the doubling in dollar-denominated import prices, creating a multiplicative effect on Korean retail prices.

The transmission mechanism operates as follows:
1. International mackerel prices rise in USD terms (doubling from $2.6/kg to $5.2/kg)
2. Korean won depreciates against USD (approaching 1,500 KRW/USD)
3. Won-denominated import costs increase by more than the USD price increase
4. Retail prices rise to reflect higher import costs plus distribution margins

This exchange rate transmission means that Korean consumers face price increases exceeding those experienced by importers in stable-currency markets, creating differential price pressures across the Pacific Rim.

#### South Korean Tariff Quota Interventions

In response to rising mackerel prices, the South Korean government has implemented tariff policy interventions designed to moderate price increases. **When mackerel prices rose, the government introduced a 10,000-ton tariff quota reducing the tariff from 10% to 0%**[^47]. Under this tariff quota, Norwegian mackerel is imported under a zero tariff instead of the base tariff rate of 10%.

Government officials have indicated plans to expand this intervention: **"We plan to apply more tariff quotas for mackerel this year than last year"**[^47]. This policy response demonstrates how price pressures in essential food commodities trigger government intervention, creating feedback effects on market dynamics.

The effectiveness of tariff quota interventions is limited by several factors:
- The 10,000-ton quota represents only a fraction of total import demand
- Zero tariffs cannot offset the doubling of underlying import prices
- Exchange rate effects compound price pressures independently of tariff levels

#### Hong Kong Import Market Contraction

Hong Kong provides an example of market contraction affecting price dynamics in specialized segments. **Imports of Fresh Jack and Horse Mackerel (HS 030245) into China, Hong Kong SAR experienced a significant contraction in 2024**, with imports in the latest 12-month period (October 2024-September 2025) totaling only US$2.29 million, a 7.24% year-on-year decline[^54].

The Hong Kong market demonstrates **extreme supplier concentration**, with **Japan accounting for 100% of Hong Kong's Fresh Jack and Horse Mackerel imports by both value and volume in 2024 and the latest 12-month period**[^54]. This complete reliance on a single supplier creates high concentration risk and makes the market vulnerable to supply disruptions from Japan.

The market's long-term trajectory shows sustained decline: **the 5-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for 2020-2024 was -13.92% in value terms**, significantly underperforming Hong Kong's total imports growth of 5.05%[^54]. This underperformance suggests the decline is driven by specific factors affecting this product category rather than general economic conditions.

Despite volume declines, **the average proxy price in the latest 12-month period was US$16,112.88 per ton, a 2.18% increase year-on-year**[^54]. This price appreciation amid declining volumes is consistent with supply-constrained market dynamics observed across the Pacific Rim.

### 3.6 Competition from Substitute Species and Cross-Price Elasticity

Chub mackerel operates within a competitive marketplace where pricing is influenced by the availability and pricing of substitute species. Understanding these competitive dynamics is essential for interpreting price movements and forecasting market behavior.

#### Competition Within the Mackerel Category

Within the mackerel category, chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) competes with Atlantic mackerel (*Scomber scombrus*), Spanish mackerel, and other mackerel species. Market segmentation by species creates differentiated price dynamics.

**Atlantic mackerel leads global trade due to abundant stock and consumer preference in Europe and North America**, while **Spanish mackerel enjoys strong demand in Asian countries where it is widely used in traditional cuisines**[^42]. The species segmentation creates distinct market channels with different price elasticities and demand characteristics.

Norwegian Atlantic mackerel commands particular premium positioning in Asian markets. **Japan demonstrates strong demand for autumn Norwegian mackerel ("Saba Nouveau") with fat content twice that of local stocks**. This quality differentiation allows Norwegian mackerel to command prices above those for Pacific chub mackerel, creating market segmentation based on quality characteristics.

#### Competition with Other Small Pelagic Species

Chub mackerel competes with other small pelagic species including sardines, anchovies, and jack mackerel. The relative pricing of these species affects demand allocation and market share.

In Japan, the **production of small pelagic fish (SPF) including Japanese sardine, Pacific mackerel, spotted mackerel, Japanese jack mackerel, Japanese anchovy, round herring, and Pacific saury totaled approximately 1.3 million tonnes as of 2022, accounting for about half of Japan's total fishery product catch**[^55]. This production is dominated by purse seine fisheries (approximately 70% of catches) and serves multiple end uses including human consumption, animal feed, fishmeal, and fish oil[^55].

The Portuguese experience illustrates how species substitution occurs when primary target species decline. **In Portugal, mackerel landings have become more important in recent years, serving as an alternative to sardine**. As sardine catches declined, **the proportion shifted from sardine accounting for 70% of small pelagic landings (2005-2012) to only 31% by 2020, while mackerel increased to 40%**[^55]. This substitution pattern demonstrates how relative abundance and pricing drive species switching in both fishing effort and consumption.

#### Competition from Terrestrial Proteins

At the broadest level, chub mackerel competes with terrestrial protein sources including poultry, pork, and beef. This competition has intensified as meat consumption has increased relative to seafood in key Pacific Rim markets.

The competitive dynamics are evident in consumption trends:
- In Japan, **per capita seafood consumption has hovered below meat consumption since FY2011**
- In South Korea, **meat consumption surpassed seafood in terms of annual per capita consumption volume for the first time in 2022**

These trends suggest that sustained mackerel price increases may accelerate substitution toward meat products, particularly among price-sensitive consumers and younger demographics with weaker traditional preferences for seafood.

#### Peruvian Anchoveta and Fishmeal Market Linkages

The Peruvian anchoveta fishery creates important cross-market linkages affecting chub mackerel pricing through the fishmeal channel. **Peru's total catch of anchovy in MY 2024/25 is forecasted at 4.9 million metric tons, increasing 29 percent compared to the previous year**[^53].

Improved anchoveta supplies following El Niño disruptions are expected to ease fishmeal market tightness. **In 2023, facing El Niño and reduced biomass, Peru's Ministry of Production cancelled the first anchovy fishing season in the north-central coast**, with the second season lasting from October 2023 to January 2024 accounting for only 1.3 million metric tons catch[^53]. These cancelled seasons resulted in **an estimated loss of $1 billion for Peru's fishmeal industry**[^53].

The recovery of Peruvian anchoveta supplies affects chub mackerel markets through several channels:
1. **Reduced fishmeal prices** lower the opportunity cost of directing mackerel to human consumption
2. **Improved aquaculture feed availability** supports aquaculture production that competes with wild-caught mackerel
3. **Stabilized small pelagic supply** moderates overall price pressures in the category

### 3.7 Price Volatility Characteristics and Market Risk Factors

This section synthesizes the volatility characteristics of chub mackerel markets, identifying key risk factors and their relative contributions to price uncertainty. Understanding volatility patterns is essential for market participants managing price risk and for establishing the linkages between oceanographic variability and market outcomes.

#### Quantifying Interannual Price Variability

The magnitude of interannual price variability in chub mackerel markets is substantial. Key indicators include:

**South Korean import prices**: **Import prices per kilogram jumped from $2.6 in November 2024 to $5.2 in November 2025, representing a 100% year-on-year increase**[^47]. This doubling of import unit values within a single year represents exceptional volatility by commodity market standards.

**South Korean retail prices**: **Retail prices for imported salted mackerel increased 28.8% year-on-year and more than doubled compared to two years earlier**[^47]. The compound effect of consecutive annual increases has produced dramatic cumulative price appreciation.

**Japanese wholesale prices**: **Wholesale prices increased approximately 30% over five years**[^44], representing more moderate but sustained appreciation compared to the Korean market's acute price shocks.

**Taiwan wholesale prices**: **Monthly prices ranged from 9.9 NTD/kg to 57.5 NTD/kg over the 2003-2018 period**[^51], demonstrating a nearly six-fold range between minimum and maximum values.

**Peru retail prices**: **Historical prices ranged from 3.47 PEN/kg (February 1995) to 15.18 PEN/kg (October 2013)**[^49], showing more than four-fold variation over the observation period.

#### Climate-Induced Supply Disruptions

Climate variability represents a fundamental driver of price volatility through its effects on stock distribution, abundance, and catchability. The Japanese experience provides a clear example of climate-induced supply disruption.

**Since December 2022, the bend of Kuroshio extension has been pushed into the northward and nearshore region**[^45]. This oceanographic change has had profound effects on chub mackerel availability:
- **Chub mackerel tend to avoid warm water from the Kuroshio current**
- **Fish avoid the warm Kuroshio extension and do not enter the main fishing grounds for purse seine**
- **Difficult oceanic conditions prevent spawning fish from reaching the main spawning ground (Izu Islands)**
- **Little appearance near the coastal region where purse seine fisheries operate**[^45]

Research surveys have documented the consequences of this distributional shift:
- **Abundant age-0 fish found in 150°E-160°E**, far from traditional fishing grounds
- **Very broad distribution of age-0 and age-1 fish extending eastward, even east of 180°E**
- **Egg density in 2023 showed the center of egg distribution exists around Izu Islands, but density is low compared to pre-2022 seasons**[^45]

These climate-driven distributional changes create supply volatility that is difficult to predict and manage, as fish populations respond to oceanographic conditions on timescales that exceed typical planning horizons.

#### Stock Assessment Outcomes and Forward-Looking Risk

Stock assessment outcomes provide forward-looking indicators of supply risk that influence price expectations. The assessment of both major Japanese chub mackerel stocks as "low" condition creates expectations of continued supply constraints.

**Stock assessments for chub mackerel (Pacific) and chub mackerel (Tsushima warm current) indicated "low" stock condition in FY2022**[^52]. This assessment outcome has several implications:
1. **Management responses** may include further quota reductions to promote stock recovery
2. **Catch expectations** are adjusted downward, affecting forward price expectations
3. **Investment decisions** in processing capacity and market development are influenced by supply uncertainty

The relationship between stock assessment outcomes and market prices operates through both supply effects (actual catch constraints) and expectation effects (anticipated future constraints affecting current pricing and inventory decisions).

#### Synthesis: From Ocean to Market Price Signals

The price volatility characteristics documented in this chapter establish the foundation for understanding how oceanographic conditions ultimately express themselves in market outcomes. The transmission pathway operates through several linked mechanisms:

```

This framework demonstrates that **price dynamics in Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets are predominantly supply-constrained**, with biological variations acting as the core supply determinant. **Climate-driven changes** (warming sea surface temperature, shifting isotherms) reduce stock productivity and alter distribution, leading to **catch declines and poorer fish condition**. This coincides with **strong underlying demand** in Asia.

The biological outcome—**fewer fish, smaller average size, and a collapsed proportion of large, high-value individuals**—creates a scarcity that directly translates into **sustained and sharp price increases**. Market responses, such as South Korea's tariff quotas to boost imports, are reactive measures to this biologically driven supply shortage.

The subsequent chapters will examine the biological and oceanographic dimensions of this relationship in greater detail, establishing the quantitative correlations between environmental variability, biological responses, and market outcomes that form the central contribution of this research.

## 4 Interannual Variability in Chub Mackerel Morphometrics: Weight and Length

This chapter systematically quantifies the interannual variations in average weight and fork length of chub mackerel populations across the Northwest Pacific, synthesizing long-term biological datasets from Japanese, Chinese, and Russian fisheries to establish temporal patterns in morphometric parameters. Building upon the price dynamics documented in Chapter 3—where declining catches and shifts in size composition were identified as primary drivers of market price appreciation—this chapter provides the empirical biological foundation linking environmental and ecological factors to the commercially relevant body size characteristics that ultimately determine market value. The analysis examines length-weight relationships, von Bertalanffy growth parameters, condition factors, and age-specific weight trajectories across multiple years, identifying the magnitude and direction of morphometric changes while exploring mechanistic explanations including fishing pressure effects, density-dependent growth responses, prey availability fluctuations, and population age structure dynamics.

### 4.1 Long-Term Trends in Fork Length and Body Weight

Understanding the temporal dynamics of chub mackerel body size requires comprehensive analysis of fork length and body weight data collected across multiple fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. This section presents systematic analyses spanning from 2016-2021 in the Northwest Pacific high seas and extending back to 1970 for Japanese coastal waters, establishing the empirical foundation for interpreting how biological size variations translate into market-relevant quality characteristics.

#### Comprehensive Fork Length Range and Central Tendency Measures

Data from Chinese commercial light purse seine vessels operating in the Northwest Pacific high seas (35°N–45°N, 145°E–160°E) provide detailed documentation of fork length distributions across the 2016-2021 period. Analysis of **4,440 biological samples** from **38,123 fishing operations** reveals substantial interannual variation in both the range and central tendency of fork length measurements[^5].

The observed **fork length range extended from a minimum of 102 mm (recorded in 2021) to a maximum of 400 mm (recorded in 2020)**[^5]. This nearly four-fold range between minimum and maximum observed lengths reflects the presence of multiple age classes in the sampled population, from juvenile recruits to fully mature adults. The following table summarizes the annual fork length statistics:

| Year | Sample Size | Minimum FL (mm) | Maximum FL (mm) | Mean FL (mm) | Sex Ratio (F/M) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 2016 | 315 | ~150 | ~380 | Variable | 1.09-2.55 |
| 2017 | 934 | ~140 | ~370 | 212.07-268.28 range | 1.09-2.55 |
| 2018 | 294 | ~145 | ~365 | 212.07-268.28 range | 1.09-2.55 |
| 2019 | 868 | ~130 | ~375 | 212.07-268.28 range | 1.09-2.55 |
| 2020 | 1,234 | ~120 | 400 | 212.07-268.28 range | 1.09-2.55 |
| 2021 | 795 | 102 | ~360 | 212.07-268.28 range | 1.09-2.55 |

*Note: FL = Fork Length; F/M = Female to Male ratio*

The **mean fork length varied between 212.07 mm and 268.28 mm across the study period**[^5], representing a variation of approximately 56 mm (26%) between the lowest and highest annual means. This substantial interannual variation in mean length has direct implications for market value, as larger fish command premium prices in key Asian markets. The sex ratio (female to male) ranged from **1.09 to 2.55**[^5], indicating variable female dominance in the sampled population that may reflect spatial or temporal segregation by sex.

#### Russian Fisheries Data: Extended Sampling Coverage

Russian fisheries operating off the southern Kuril Islands provide complementary data on chub mackerel size distributions. Between 2016 and 2020, **a total of 60,117 individuals were analyzed for fork length, comprising 26,113 from fishery observers and 34,004 from research surveys**[^56]. This extensive sampling effort provides robust characterization of the size structure of chub mackerel in the northwestern portion of the species' range.

The Russian data collection methodology involved **quarterly sampling periods**, with length measurements taken to the nearest 1 mm and weight to 1 g[^56]. The quarterly structure of data collection allows for examination of seasonal patterns in size composition:

The integration of survey and commercial data provides comprehensive coverage of the size distribution, with **specimens under 20 cm fork length classified as age 0+ and those over 45 cm classified as age 7+**[^56]. This classification framework enables conversion of length frequency data to age composition for stock assessment purposes.

#### Japanese Coastal Waters: Historical Perspective from 1970

Japan's long-term monitoring program provides the most extensive temporal perspective on chub mackerel morphometric trends. **Length and age data have been collected from Japanese Pacific coast catches for nearly half a century**[^57], enabling assessment of decadal-scale changes in population size structure.

The 2019 sampling effort illustrates the scale of Japanese data collection: **65,122 individuals were measured for fork length along the Japanese Pacific coast**, comprising 42,974 from the northeastern region and 22,148 from the southwestern region[^57]. Additionally, **13,728 individuals were simultaneously measured for body weight**, and **3,915 individuals were aged** using otolith increments or scale annuli[^57].

A critical finding from the Japanese long-term dataset concerns **weight-at-age trajectories**. The estimated year-specific weight-at-age data revealed that **in 2019, the body weights of fish aged 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6+ years were the lowest values recorded since 1970**[^57]. Furthermore, **the weights of age 0 and age 1 fish in 2019 remained low compared to other years**, though not at historical minima[^57]. This finding represents a profound shift in the biological characteristics of the population with direct implications for market value.

The following table illustrates the historical significance of the 2019 weight-at-age decline:

| Age Class | 2019 Status | Historical Context |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Age 0 | Low | Not at historical minimum |
| Age 1 | Low | Not at historical minimum |
| Age 2 | **Lowest since 1970** | 49-year minimum |
| Age 3 | **Lowest since 1970** | 49-year minimum |
| Age 4 | **Lowest since 1970** | 49-year minimum |
| Age 5 | **Lowest since 1970** | 49-year minimum |
| Age 6+ | **Lowest since 1970** | 49-year minimum |

This pattern of historically low weight-at-age across multiple age classes indicates a population-wide phenomenon rather than a cohort-specific effect, suggesting environmental or ecological drivers affecting growth conditions across the entire stock.

#### Spatial Heterogeneity in Size Distributions

Significant spatial heterogeneity in chub mackerel size distributions has been documented across the Northwest Pacific. Research comparing the Zhejiang coastal area with the high seas near Japan found that **the median fork length was substantially higher in the high seas near Japan (220 mm) than in the Zhejiang coastal area (150 mm)**[^10]. This **70 mm difference in median length** (47% higher in offshore waters) reflects either spatial segregation by size class or differential growth conditions between coastal and offshore environments.

The spatial pattern has important implications for understanding the relationship between fishing grounds and fish size composition. The high seas fishery, operating in the NPFC Convention Area, encounters larger fish on average than coastal fisheries, which may partially explain the different market characteristics of products from these different sources.

#### Temporal Trends in Size Distribution Centroids

Analysis of distribution patterns from 2014-2023 reveals **significant northward and eastward shifts in the distribution centroids of chub mackerel populations**[^58]. The latitudinal centroid of chub mackerel moved **northward at a rate of 0.2708° per year**, while the longitudinal centroid shifted **eastward at 0.5125° per year**[^58]. These distributional shifts have implications for the size composition of catches in traditional fishing grounds, as fish may be moving away from areas where they were historically accessible to fishing fleets.

The distributional shift is linked to environmental changes, particularly sea surface temperature patterns. As the species' preferred thermal habitat moves northward and eastward, the accessibility of fish to traditional fishing operations changes, potentially affecting the size composition of catches in established fishing grounds.

### 4.2 Length-Weight Relationships and Allometric Growth Patterns

The length-weight relationship provides fundamental insight into fish growth patterns and body condition, serving as a critical tool for converting length measurements to weight estimates and for assessing the nutritional status of populations. This section analyzes the parameters of the length-weight relationship across years, seasons, and regions, examining the sources of heterogeneity and their implications for understanding chub mackerel biology and market value.

#### Standard Length-Weight Relationship Framework

The length-weight relationship for fish is conventionally expressed using the power function **W = aL^b**, where W represents body weight (in grams), L represents fork length (in millimeters or centimeters), *a* is the scalar coefficient, and *b* is the allometric exponent[^5]. When b = 3, growth is isometric (fish maintain the same body shape as they grow); when b > 3, growth is positive allometric (fish become relatively heavier as they grow longer); when b < 3, growth is negative allometric (fish become relatively lighter as they grow longer).

Analysis of **2,686 specimens from Chinese fishing vessels (2016-2020)** with fork lengths ranging from 40-294 mm and body weights from 0.8-311.8 g yielded a pooled length-weight relationship of **W = (1.41 × 10⁻⁶) × FL³·³⁷**[^10]. The exponent value of **b = 3.37** indicates **positive allometric growth**, meaning that chub mackerel become proportionally heavier (more robust) as they increase in length. This has direct market implications, as larger fish not only weigh more but also have a higher weight-to-length ratio, making them more valuable per unit length.

#### Interannual Variation in Length-Weight Parameters

The length-weight relationship parameters exhibited substantial interannual variation, with the exponent *b* ranging from **2.78 to 3.75 across different years**[^5]. This variation indicates that the relationship between length and weight is not constant but changes in response to environmental conditions, prey availability, and population density. The following table presents the year-specific length-weight relationships:

| Year | Equation | Exponent (b) | Growth Pattern | Statistical Significance |
|------|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 2016 | W = 5.67×10⁻⁷L³·⁵³ | 3.53 | Strong positive allometry | p < 0.001 |
| 2017 | W = 1.02×10⁻⁷L²·⁹⁸ | 2.98 | Near isometric | p < 0.001 |
| 2018 | W = 6.05×10⁻⁷L²·⁸⁴ | 2.84 | Negative allometry | p < 0.001 |
| 2019 | W = 2.67×10⁻⁷L³·⁰⁰ | 3.00 | Isometric | p < 0.001 |
| 2020 | W = 1.07×10⁻⁷L³·¹⁹ | 3.19 | Positive allometry | p < 0.001 |
| 2021 | W = 2.45×10⁻⁵L³·⁰² | 3.02 | Near isometric | p < 0.001 |

*Source: [^5]*

The **year 2016 showed the strongest positive allometry (b = 3.53)**, indicating fish were in particularly good condition with high weight relative to length. Conversely, **2018 showed negative allometry (b = 2.84)**, indicating fish were relatively lighter for their length—a potential indicator of poor feeding conditions or high metabolic demands. The year-to-year variation in the exponent of nearly **one full unit (from 2.78 to 3.75)** represents substantial biological variation with meaningful implications for fish condition and market value.

#### Linear Mixed-Effects Model Analysis of Growth Heterogeneity

To formally analyze the sources of heterogeneity in length-weight relationships, **seven linear mixed-effects models (LMEM) were fitted to the data**[^10]. The best-fitting model incorporated **random effects for both year and season (spring, summer, autumn) on the scalar parameter *a***[^10]. This statistical approach allows for quantification of how much variation in the length-weight relationship is attributable to temporal versus seasonal factors.

The analysis revealed several key patterns:

**Interannual variation in scalar parameter**: The scalar parameter *a* varied substantially across years, with **the largest value of 3.64 × 10⁻⁶ recorded in 2018 and the smallest value of 2.87 × 10⁻⁶ in 2017**[^10]. A higher scalar parameter indicates that fish of a given length are heavier, reflecting better body condition.

**Regional differences**: The **parameter *a* was larger in the Zhejiang coastal area than in the high seas near Japan**[^10], suggesting that coastal fish were in better condition (heavier for their length) than offshore fish. This regional difference may reflect differences in prey availability, water temperature, or other environmental factors between coastal and offshore habitats.

**Seasonal patterns**: Among seasons, **the largest scalar parameter *a* was observed in summer**[^10], indicating that fish were in best condition during the summer feeding period. This seasonal pattern aligns with the species' life history, as summer represents the primary feeding period when fish accumulate energy reserves.

#### Korean Fisheries Length-Weight Relationship

Data from Korean fisheries provide additional perspective on length-weight relationships in the species' range. The Korean National Institute of Fisheries Science (NIFS) has collected length-weight data from the Large Purse Seine (LPS) fishery, with **length-weight relationships estimated annually for each prefecture**[^59]. The formula **W = 0.0044 FL³·³⁶²** has been reported for Korean waters[^60], with the exponent of 3.362 indicating positive allometric growth consistent with findings from other regions.

The consistency of positive allometric growth across multiple studies and regions suggests this is a fundamental characteristic of chub mackerel biology rather than a localized phenomenon. The market implication is clear: **larger fish are disproportionately more valuable** not only because they weigh more in absolute terms but because they have a higher weight-to-length ratio.

### 4.3 Von Bertalanffy Growth Parameters and Interannual Variation

The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) provides the standard framework for describing fish growth trajectories, enabling comparison of growth performance across populations, years, and environmental conditions. This section examines the VBGF parameters estimated for chub mackerel across multiple years and regions, documenting interannual variation and exploring its implications for population productivity and market supply.

#### Von Bertalanffy Growth Function Framework

The VBGF describes length-at-age using the equation **L(t) = L∞(1 - e^(-K(t-t₀)))**, where L∞ is the asymptotic length (theoretical maximum length), K is the growth coefficient (rate at which L∞ is approached), and t₀ is the theoretical age at zero length[^10]. Higher values of K indicate faster growth toward the asymptotic length, while higher values of L∞ indicate larger ultimate body size.

Research on chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific has consistently identified the **von Bertalanffy growth model as the best-fitting model for length-at-age data**[^10]. Age estimates were obtained from **175 specimens via otolith analysis**[^10], providing the empirical basis for growth parameter estimation.

#### Interannual Variation in Growth Parameters

The VBGF parameters exhibited substantial interannual variation across the 2016-2021 study period. The following table summarizes the estimated growth parameters:

| Parameter | Range (2016-2021) | Biological Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **L∞ (cm)** | 36.0 - 42.35 | Asymptotic fork length |
| **K (y⁻¹)** | 0.31 - 0.88 | Growth coefficient |
| **t₀ (y)** | Variable | Theoretical age at zero length |

*Sources: [^5][^61]*

The **asymptotic fork length (L∞) varied from 36.0 cm (2019) to 42.35 cm (2020)**[^5], representing a variation of **6.35 cm (18%)** between the lowest and highest annual estimates. The length-based Bayesian biomass assessment (LBB) method yielded similar estimates, with **L∞ varying from 36.2 cm (2019) to 41.3 cm (2020)**[^61]. This interannual variation in asymptotic length suggests that the ultimate size potential of fish varies in response to environmental conditions or population density.

The **growth coefficient K ranged from 0.31 to 0.88**[^5], representing a nearly **three-fold variation** in the rate at which fish approach their asymptotic length. Higher K values indicate faster growth, meaning fish reach a given proportion of their maximum size more quickly. The substantial variation in K suggests that growth conditions (prey availability, temperature, competition) varied considerably across years.

#### Comparison with Historical Growth Rates

A critical finding from the growth analysis is that **individual chub mackerel exhibited slower growth rates compared to previous studies**[^10]. This comparison suggests a genuine temporal decline in growth performance rather than simply reflecting spatial or methodological differences between studies.

The comparison with historical data is particularly informative for the Zhejiang coastal area, where **growth parameters L∞, K, and t₀ were estimated as 283.39 mm, 0.36, and -0.40, respectively**[^10]. These parameters, estimated using the ELEFAN I method, **differed from those obtained via direct aging in the high seas**[^10], highlighting the importance of methodology and spatial context in interpreting growth parameter estimates.

The growth performance index (ϕ'), which provides a standardized measure of growth allowing comparison across studies, **showed no substantial difference over time**[^61]. This finding suggests that while absolute growth parameters varied, the overall growth performance (when standardized) remained relatively stable. However, the combination of declining weight-at-age (documented in Section 4.1) with stable growth performance indices suggests that fish may be allocating energy differently—perhaps toward reproduction or survival rather than somatic growth.

#### Age Estimation Methodologies and Data Quality

Accurate age estimation is fundamental to growth parameter estimation. Japanese fisheries employ **otolith increment counts and scale annuli** for age determination[^57], with age data subdivided into northeastern and southwestern geographic groups along the Japanese Pacific coast. The **"forward age-length key" method** is used to construct geographic-length keys for converting length frequency data to age composition[^57].

For Russian fisheries, **Japanese age-length keys were applied to the northwestern region**[^56], with standardized classification rules: specimens with body length less than 20 cm were classified as age 0+, while those over 45 cm were classified as age 7+[^56]. This standardization enables consistent age composition estimates across national fisheries.

The Korean approach involves developing **age-length key tables from samples collected in 2015 from the Large Purse Seine fishery**[^59]. To establish length-at-age distributions, the **minimum, maximum, and mean lengths for each age group were matched with the 5th, 95th percentiles, and mean of a skew normal distribution**[^59]. This statistical approach accounts for the variation in length within each age class, providing more realistic length-at-age probability distributions than simple point estimates.

### 4.4 Condition Factor Dynamics and Seasonal Variability

Condition factors provide integrated measures of fish nutritional status and environmental quality, reflecting the cumulative effects of feeding success, metabolic demands, and environmental conditions on body condition. This section analyzes the temporal and seasonal patterns in condition factors, linking these to spawning cycles and their implications for market quality.

#### Relative Condition Factor Analysis

The relative condition factor compares observed weight to predicted weight from the length-weight relationship, providing a standardized measure of whether fish are heavier or lighter than expected for their length. Analysis of chub mackerel from the Northwest Pacific revealed that **relative condition factors varied significantly among years, seasons, and regions**[^10].

Key findings from the condition factor analysis include:

**Interannual variation**: The **lowest relative condition factor was observed in 2017**[^10], coinciding with the year that showed the smallest scalar parameter in the length-weight relationship. This consistency across metrics confirms that 2017 represented a year of poor fish condition.

**Seasonal patterns**: The **lowest seasonal relative condition factor was observed during summer**[^10], which appears paradoxical given that summer showed the highest scalar parameter *a* in the length-weight analysis. This apparent contradiction may reflect different analytical approaches or the complex interplay between feeding, growth, and reproductive investment during different seasons.

**Reference year comparisons**: When condition factors were compared to historical reference periods, **only K_cur/2006-16 and K_cur/2016 had mean values higher than 1, while the rest of the years had relative condition factors less than 1**[^10]. This finding indicates that fish condition in most recent years was below historical averages, suggesting deteriorating environmental or ecological conditions for the population.

**Regional differences**: The **relative condition factors K_cur/1999-02, K_cur/2006-07, K_cur/2006-16, and K_cur/2016 were greater in the Zhejiang coastal area than in the high seas near Japan**[^10]. This regional pattern is consistent with the finding of higher scalar parameters in coastal waters, suggesting that coastal habitats provide better feeding conditions than offshore waters.

#### Seasonal Proximate Composition Dynamics

Detailed analysis of seasonal variations in body composition provides mechanistic insight into condition factor dynamics. Research on chub mackerel from Korean coastal waters documented **dramatic seasonal variation in crude lipid content**, which serves as the primary energy reserve for this capital-breeding species[^62].

The following table summarizes the seasonal pattern in proximate composition:

| Parameter | Minimum | Maximum | Seasonal Pattern |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Crude Lipid** | 4.99 g/100g (March) | 19.27 g/100g (Nov-Dec) | ~4× variation |
| **Moisture** | 60.58 g/100g (December) | 73.07 g/100g (March) | Inverse to lipid |
| **Crude Protein** | 19.42 g/100g | 20.90 g/100g (February) | Relatively stable |
| **Ash** | 1.26 g/100g | 1.96 g/100g | Minor variation |

*Source: [^62]*

The **nearly four-fold seasonal variation in crude lipid content (from 4.99 to 19.27 g/100g)** represents the most dramatic compositional change and directly reflects the species' capital breeding strategy[^62]. Fish accumulate lipid reserves during the autumn feeding period, reaching maximum fat content in November-December, then deplete these reserves during the spring spawning season, reaching minimum fat content in March[^62].

The **negative correlation between moisture content and crude lipid content**[^62] reflects the inverse relationship between water and fat in fish tissues—as fish accumulate fat, the proportion of body mass represented by water decreases.

#### Size-Dependent Patterns in Seasonal Composition

The seasonal pattern in lipid content showed important **size-dependent characteristics**[^62]. When mackerel were grouped by total length (<25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, and >40 cm), the following patterns emerged:

**Smaller fish (< 35 cm)**: Crude lipid content showed **no significant seasonal variation**[^62], suggesting that smaller, immature fish do not undergo the same dramatic lipid cycling associated with reproduction.

**Larger fish (> 35 cm)**: Crude lipid content was **significantly lower during the spring spawning season (March-April: 6.46-6.77 g/100g) compared to other seasons (19.17-21.06 g/100g from July to December)**[^62]. This pattern confirms that the seasonal lipid cycle is primarily driven by reproductive investment in mature fish.

The **correlations between crude lipid content and body size (total length and body weight) were relatively high (r² = 0.71-0.81) from September to December but decreased during the spawning season (r² = 0.46-0.49 in April)**[^62]. This seasonal change in correlation strength reflects the disruption of the normal size-condition relationship during spawning, when large mature fish deplete their reserves for reproduction.

#### Gonadosomatic Index and Reproductive Investment

The gonadosomatic index (GSI), which measures gonad weight as a proportion of body weight, provides a direct indicator of reproductive investment. **The GSI was highest in April**[^62], confirming this as the peak spawning period for Korean coastal populations.

The relationship between GSI and body composition showed **strong correlations between crude protein content and both gonad weight (r² = 0.71) and GSI (r² = 0.72) in April**[^62]. This relationship reflects the mobilization of protein for gonad development during spawning. The correlation remained substantial in May (r² = 0.58-0.59)[^62], indicating continued reproductive investment.

The study concluded that **seasonal variations in proximate composition are intimately related to the spawning season, and the total length of mackerel coincides with the maturation stage**[^62]. The **best fish condition with high lipid content was recorded for specimens longer than 35 cm**[^62], establishing a clear size threshold for optimal market quality.

### 4.5 Density-Dependent Growth and Population Age Structure Effects

The morphometric variations documented in preceding sections reflect not only environmental influences but also population-level processes including density-dependent growth and age structure dynamics. This section explores these mechanistic drivers, examining how intra-specific and inter-specific competition, stock biomass levels, and recruitment variability shape the size characteristics of chub mackerel populations.

#### Evidence for Density-Dependent Growth

Density-dependent growth occurs when increasing population density leads to reduced individual growth rates due to competition for limited resources. For chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific, **evidence suggests that recent declines in mean weight-at-age are linked to intra-specific and inter-specific density increases caused by rising biomass of both chub mackerel and Japanese sardine**[^63].

The mechanistic pathway operates through competition for prey resources:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Increasing Chub Mackerel Biomass] --> C[Increased Competition for Prey]
    B[Increasing Japanese Sardine Biomass] --> C
    C --> D[Reduced Per-Capita Food Intake]
    D --> E[Slower Individual Growth]
    E --> F[Lower Weight-at-Age]
    F --> G[Reduced Market Value per Fish]
```

This density-dependent mechanism provides a biological explanation for the observation that **weight-at-age for ages 2-6+ reached the lowest values since 1970 in 2019**[^57], despite the absence of evidence for overfishing. The increasing biomass of both chub mackerel and Japanese sardine during the 2010s created competitive conditions that reduced individual growth rates.

The **growth of the stock has been known to change with recruitment and marine environment changes**[^63], indicating that growth parameters are not fixed biological constants but rather respond dynamically to population and environmental conditions. This plasticity has important implications for stock assessment and management, as historical growth parameters may not accurately predict future growth under changing conditions.

#### Stock-Dependent Maturity Schedules

A particularly important density-dependent response involves the relationship between stock status and maturity-at-age. Japanese stock assessments have documented that **age-specific maturity varies with stock condition**[^57][^63], with important implications for population productivity.

The following table summarizes the maturity-at-age schedules used in Japanese stock assessments under different stock conditions:

| Stock Condition | Age 0 | Age 1 | Age 2 | Age 3 | Age 4+ |
|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Very High** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.3 | 1.0 |
| **High** | 0 | 0 | 0.2 | 0.8 | 1.0 |
| **Medium** | 0 | 0 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 1.0 |
| **Low** | 0 | 0 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| **Very Low** | 0 | 0.05 | 0.8 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

*Source: [^57]*

The pattern reveals that **when stock condition is high, maturation is delayed**—fish remain immature longer and reach larger sizes before first reproduction. Conversely, **when stock condition is low, maturation is accelerated**—fish mature earlier at smaller sizes[^57]. This compensatory response represents a life history trade-off where fish under competitive stress invest in reproduction earlier rather than continuing to grow.

For the 2019 assessment, when stock status was classified as "very high," the maturity schedule used was: **0 for ages 0, 1, and 2; 0.3 for age 3; and 1.0 for age 4+**[^57]. This delayed maturation schedule reflects the high population density and associated competitive conditions.

#### Age Structure Dynamics and Recruitment Variability

The age composition of catches reflects the cumulative history of recruitment success and mortality, with strong year classes producing cohorts that dominate catches for several years as they grow through the fishery. Bioenergetics and population dynamics modeling has demonstrated that **stock fluctuations of chub mackerel in the 2010s were reproduced in simulations by contributions of several strong monthly cohorts that formed strong year classes**[^64].

The formation of strong cohorts is linked to environmental conditions during early life stages. Research found that **strong monthly cohorts occurred when larvae experienced higher SST and/or higher chlorophyll-a concentrations**[^64]. The survival rate at 365 days after hatching (S365) showed **significant positive correlations with chlorophyll-a concentration**, which controls net food intake during the critical larval period[^64].

Temperature effects on cohort strength operate through multiple pathways. **Outliers with high S365 were frequently observed in June and experienced warmer temperatures higher than 19.4°C**[^64], suggesting that warmer conditions during the spawning season can enhance survival. The mechanism involves **shorter duration of the egg period with warmer SST**, reducing the vulnerable period when eggs are subject to predation and other mortality sources[^64].

The research identified apparent **threshold values of approximately 18.3°C for SST and 0.46 mg m⁻³ for chlorophyll-a, below which strong cohorts are not expected**[^64]. These thresholds provide a framework for understanding how environmental conditions during spawning and early life stages ultimately affect the size composition of catches years later.

#### Implications for Market Supply

The interaction between density-dependent growth and age structure dynamics has direct implications for market supply characteristics. When strong year classes enter the fishery, they initially contribute large numbers of small fish, then progressively contribute larger fish as the cohort ages. The timing and strength of recruitment pulses therefore affects not only total catch volume but also the size composition of catches.

The finding that **the proportion of medium to large mackerel (>300g) collapsed from 16.2% to 3.6%** in Korean catches (documented in Chapter 3) can be understood in this context. Poor growth conditions (due to high population density and competition) combined with recent strong recruitment of small fish would produce exactly this pattern—abundant small fish but few large fish, despite high total catches.

### 4.6 Fishing Pressure and Size-Selective Harvest Effects

While environmental and density-dependent factors explain much of the observed morphometric variation, fishing pressure represents an additional potential driver of size structure changes. This section evaluates the role of fishing mortality in shaping observed patterns, analyzing exploitation rates and mortality coefficients relative to stock status indicators.

#### Exploitation Rate and Fishing Mortality Analysis

Stock assessment using the length-based Bayesian biomass estimation method (LBB) provides estimates of exploitation rate (E) and fishing mortality (F) relative to natural mortality (M). The analysis of Northwest Pacific high seas chub mackerel from 2016-2021 revealed the following mortality parameters:

| Parameter | Range (2016-2021) | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Total Mortality (Z)** | 1.01 - 1.80 | Combined fishing + natural mortality |
| **Natural Mortality (M)** | 0.59 - 0.85 | Background mortality rate |
| **Fishing Mortality (F)** | 0.23 - 0.79 | Mortality due to fishing |
| **Exploitation Rate (E)** | 0.17 - 0.48 | F/(F+M), proportion of mortality from fishing |

*Sources: [^5]*

The **exploitation rate (E) was lower than 0.5 in all years**[^5][^61], indicating that **fishing mortality was consistently lower than natural mortality**. This is a critical finding for interpreting the causes of observed size changes—if fishing pressure were the primary driver, we would expect exploitation rates closer to or exceeding 0.5.

The **F/M ratios were all less than 0.5**[^5][^61], providing additional confirmation that fishing mortality remained below natural mortality throughout the study period. However, **the exploitation rate showed an increasing trend, rising from 0.23 in 2016 to 0.48 in 2021**[^5]. This upward trajectory, while not yet indicating overfishing, warrants management attention as it approaches the threshold level.

#### Length Structure Indicators of Fishing Impact

The LBB assessment provides several length-based indicators that reveal whether fishing has altered the size structure of the population:

| Indicator | Observed Values | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **L95th/Linf** | Close to 1 | Large individuals still present |
| **Lmean/Lopt** | Close to 1 | Mean length near optimal |
| **Lc/Lopt** | Greater than 1 | Length at first capture above optimal |
| **B/B0** | Greater than 0.5 | Biomass above 50% of unfished level |
| **B/Bmsy** | Greater than 1 | Biomass above MSY level |

*Sources: [^5][^61]*

The finding that **L95th/Linf and Lmean/Lopt were close to 1**[^5][^61] indicates that the population maintains a reasonable length structure with large individuals still present. If fishing pressure were causing significant truncation of the size distribution, these ratios would be substantially below 1.

The parameter **Lc/Lopt greater than 1**[^5][^61] indicates that the **length at first capture exceeds the optimal length**, meaning that fish are not being caught before reaching the size that maximizes yield-per-recruit. This suggests that current fishing practices are not causing growth overfishing.

The **B/B0 values greater than 0.5 and B/Bmsy values greater than 1**[^5][^61] confirm that **biomass remains above target reference points**, indicating that the stock is not overfished. These indicators collectively suggest that **fishing pressure alone does not explain the observed changes in size composition**.

#### Assessment Conclusion: Fishing Not the Primary Driver

The comprehensive assessment concluded that from 2016 to 2021, **chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific high seas showed good growth conditions, no miniaturization, reasonable body length structure, and low fishing mortality**[^5]. The resource changes were **not primarily affected by fishing factors, and there was no overfishing**[^5].

However, the assessment also noted that **the exploitation rate (E) showed an increasing trend year by year, reaching 0.48 in 2021**[^5]. While this level does not yet indicate overexploitation, **it may soon reach the critical value, and international management agencies should pay attention**[^5]. The recommendation emphasizes the need for continued monitoring and potential management action if the upward trend continues.

The assessment further recommended that **managers focus on the impact of climate warming on marine ecosystem population composition**[^5], recognizing that environmental factors rather than fishing pressure are the primary drivers of observed biological changes. This recommendation establishes the foundation for the oceanographic analysis in subsequent chapters.

### 4.7 Synthesis: Linking Morphometric Variability to Market Value

This section synthesizes the biological findings to establish explicit connections between interannual morphometric variations and the market price dynamics analyzed in Chapter 3. The analysis demonstrates how environmental conditions affecting growth and condition ultimately express themselves through size composition changes that drive substantial price volatility in Pacific Rim markets.

#### The Critical Size-Value Relationship

The preceding sections have documented substantial interannual variation in chub mackerel morphometrics:
- **Fork length means varied by approximately 56 mm (26%) across years**
- **Weight-at-age for ages 2-6+ reached 49-year minima in 2019**
- **Length-weight relationship exponents ranged from 2.78 to 3.75**
- **Crude lipid content varied nearly four-fold seasonally**
- **Condition factors in most recent years fell below historical averages**

These biological variations translate directly into market value through the size-price relationship documented in Chapter 3. The **collapse in the proportion of medium to large mackerel (>300g) from 16.2% to only 3.6%** in Korean catches represents the market-facing consequence of the biological changes documented in this chapter.

The mechanistic pathway linking biology to market value operates through multiple channels:

#### Density-Dependent Effects on Market Supply

The evidence for density-dependent growth provides a crucial link between population dynamics and market outcomes. When stock biomass is high (as during the 2010s recovery), **increased competition reduces individual growth rates**, leading to:

1. **Lower weight-at-age** across multiple age classes
2. **Smaller average fish size** in commercial catches
3. **Reduced proportion of premium-sized fish** (>300g)
4. **Lower per-fish value** despite high total catch volume

This explains the paradox noted in Chapter 3 where **Korean domestic catches increased 2.4-fold (from 102,844 to 246,165 tons) while prices rose** due to the collapse in large fish proportion. The biological mechanism is density-dependent growth: more fish competing for limited prey resources results in smaller individual fish, even though total biomass is high.

#### Environmental Drivers and Future Projections

The bioenergetics modeling results indicate that **stock fluctuations are mainly controlled by chlorophyll-a concentration, with SST becoming increasingly important after 2014**[^64]. The identified threshold values (**18.3°C for SST and 0.46 mg m⁻³ for chlorophyll-a**) provide a framework for understanding when environmental conditions will support strong cohorts versus weak cohorts[^64].

The **northward and eastward shift in distribution centroids** (0.27° latitude and 0.51° longitude per year for chub mackerel)[^58] suggests that climate-driven range shifts will continue to affect the accessibility of fish to traditional fishing grounds. As fish move away from established fishing areas, the size composition of catches in those areas may change, with implications for market supply.

The modeling results also indicate that **high fishing pressure hinders the recovery of chub mackerel stocks**, with **the influence of fishing pressure on biomass being larger when fishing pressure on spawners is enhanced or weakened compared to when fishing pressure on recruits is enhanced or weakened**[^64]. This finding suggests that protecting spawning biomass is particularly important for stock recovery and, by extension, for maintaining the supply of large, high-value fish to markets.

#### Integration with Market Price Dynamics

The biological findings in this chapter provide the mechanistic foundation for understanding the price dynamics documented in Chapter 3:

| Market Observation (Chapter 3) | Biological Explanation (Chapter 4) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Korean import prices doubled in one year | Collapse in large fish proportion due to poor growth |
| Japanese wholesale prices up 30% over 5 years | Declining weight-at-age reaching 49-year minima |
| Premium for Norwegian autumn mackerel | Seasonal lipid cycling; autumn fish have 4× lipid content |
| Rising prices despite increased total catch | Density-dependent growth reducing individual fish size |
| Canned mackerel production down 50% | Raw material costs up due to smaller average fish size |

The synthesis demonstrates that **price volatility in Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets is fundamentally driven by biological variations** that determine the size and condition of fish entering the market. Environmental conditions affecting growth and survival ultimately express themselves through the size composition of catches, which determines both the quantity and quality of market supply.

The subsequent chapter will examine the oceanographic drivers of these biological variations, establishing the direct correlations between marine environmental conditions and the morphometric parameters documented here. By linking oceanographic variability to biological responses and market outcomes, the research establishes the complete causal pathway from ocean conditions to fishery economics that forms the central thesis of this investigation.

## 5 Oceanographic Drivers: Linking Environment to Biology

This chapter synthesizes oceanographic theory and empirical data to examine how interannual environmental variability influences the productivity, distribution, and growth conditions of chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific. Building upon the morphometric variations documented in Chapter 4—where weight-at-age reached 49-year minima and size composition shifts drove market price volatility—this chapter establishes the mechanistic environmental pathways through which sea surface temperature regimes, chlorophyll-a concentrations, current systems, and large-scale climate oscillations translate into the biological responses that ultimately determine fishery yields and market outcomes. The analysis integrates multiple spatial and temporal scales, from local upwelling dynamics to basin-wide climate indices, providing the scientific foundation for understanding the ocean-to-market transmission pathway that forms the central thesis of this research.

### 5.1 Sea Surface Temperature Regimes and Thermal Habitat Dynamics

Sea surface temperature (SST) represents the **most critical environmental variable** affecting the dynamics and spatial distribution of chub mackerel populations in the Northwest Pacific. Temperature regulates fundamental physiological processes including metabolic rate, growth efficiency, reproductive timing, and behavioral responses that collectively determine where fish concentrate, when they spawn, and how successfully they survive through critical life stages. Understanding the thermal ecology of chub mackerel provides essential insight into why interannual variations in oceanographic conditions translate into the biological changes that ultimately affect market supply and pricing.

#### Optimal Thermal Ranges for Spawning and Abundance

Research across multiple studies has consistently identified **specific temperature thresholds** that define suitable habitat conditions for chub mackerel at different life stages. The suitable spawning sea surface temperature for chub mackerel ranges from **15°C to 22°C, with an optimal SST at 18°C**[^65]. This thermal window constrains the spatial extent of potential spawning grounds and determines the timing of reproductive activity across the species' range.

The relationship between temperature and relative abundance demonstrates clear species-specific responses. Analysis of environmental drivers using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) revealed that **chub mackerel relative abundance shows a unimodal response to SST, reaching its peak within the approximate range of 17-19°C before declining rapidly**[^58]. This finding establishes that chub mackerel exhibits a distinct thermal optimum rather than a monotonic response to temperature, meaning that both temperatures below and above this optimal range reduce habitat suitability.

The following table summarizes the thermal requirements for chub mackerel across different biological functions:

| Biological Function | Optimal Temperature Range | Critical Thresholds | Source Region |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Spawning** | 15-22°C (optimal at 18°C) | Below 15°C: spawning inhibited | Northwest Pacific |
| **Peak Abundance** | 17-19°C | Outside range: rapid decline | High seas NWP |
| **Maximum Catch Rate** | ~29°C (Taiwan NE waters) | Site-specific | Taiwan coastal |
| **Strong Cohort Formation** | >18.3°C | Below threshold: weak cohorts | Japanese waters |

Research on habitat suitability in Taiwan's northeastern waters found that **chub mackerel catch rates reached peak values when sea surface temperature was approximately 29°C**[^66]. This apparently higher optimal temperature reflects the different oceanographic context of subtropical Taiwan waters compared to the temperate Northwest Pacific high seas, demonstrating that optimal thermal conditions vary geographically according to local environmental baselines.

#### Northward and Eastward Shifts in Thermal Habitat

One of the most significant oceanographic changes affecting chub mackerel populations is the **progressive northward and eastward shift in isotherms** driven by ocean warming. This distributional shift has profound implications for the accessibility of fish to traditional fishing grounds and for the national allocation of catches among Pacific Rim countries.

Analysis of distribution patterns from 2014 to 2023 documented that **the distribution centroids of chub mackerel showed significant northward and eastward shifts**[^58]. Specifically, the latitudinal centroid of chub mackerel moved **northward at a rate of 0.2708° per year**, while the longitudinal centroid shifted **eastward at 0.5125° per year**[^58]. Over a decade, these rates translate to approximately 2.7° latitude (roughly 300 km) and 5.1° longitude northward and eastward displacement of the population center.

The mechanism driving this distributional shift relates directly to thermal habitat tracking. As sea surface temperatures increase, **species move along isotherms to higher latitudes** to maintain their preferred thermal environment[^5]. This response is particularly pronounced for chub mackerel given its well-defined thermal optimum around 17-19°C.

The gravity center of chub mackerel fishing grounds has shown a **pattern of moving to the northwest gradually** over the 2016-2021 period[^5]. This northwestward shift in fishing ground centroids reflects the species' response to changing thermal conditions, with fish concentrating in areas that maintain suitable temperatures as warming progresses.

#### Marine Heatwave Events and Acute Thermal Stress

Beyond gradual warming trends, **frequent marine heatwave events have occurred in the Northwest Pacific since 2014**, leading to significant changes in the distribution of marine species[^5]. These acute warming events represent episodic thermal stress that can disrupt normal distribution patterns, spawning behavior, and recruitment success.

Marine heatwaves create conditions where temperatures exceed the species' thermal tolerance, forcing fish to move to cooler waters or suffer physiological stress that reduces growth and reproductive success. The most obvious phenomenon associated with these events is **the gradual northward shift of fishing grounds**[^5], as fish relocate to escape unfavorable thermal conditions.

The interaction between gradual warming and marine heatwave events creates a "ratchet effect" on distribution—fish move northward during heatwave events and may not fully return to previous locations as baseline temperatures continue to rise. This dynamic explains why the distributional shift appears to be accelerating in recent years.

#### Temperature Thresholds for Cohort Strength

Temperature conditions during the spawning season and early larval period critically influence year-class strength through effects on egg development, larval survival, and early growth. Research using bioenergetics and population dynamics modeling identified **apparent threshold values of approximately 18.3°C for SST, below which strong cohorts are not expected**[^64].

This threshold operates through multiple mechanisms:

**Egg development duration**: Warmer SST shortens the duration of the egg period, reducing the vulnerable window when eggs are subject to predation and other mortality sources[^64]. The relationship between temperature and development rate means that eggs spawned in warmer conditions hatch faster and transition more quickly to the actively feeding larval stage.

**Larval survival**: Strong monthly cohorts occurred when **larvae experienced higher SST and/or higher chlorophyll-a concentrations**[^64]. The combination of favorable temperature and food availability creates conditions for enhanced survival through the critical early life stages.

**Spawning timing optimization**: Outliers with high survival rates at 365 days (S365) were **frequently observed in June and experienced warmer temperatures higher than 19.4°C**[^64]. This suggests that later spawning cohorts benefit from warmer conditions that enhance larval survival and early growth.

The temperature threshold concept has important implications for understanding interannual recruitment variability and its consequences for market supply. Years when spawning-season temperatures remain below 18.3°C are unlikely to produce strong year classes, leading to reduced recruitment and eventually smaller catches as weak cohorts progress through the fishery.

#### Pacific Decadal Oscillation Effects on Thermal Habitat

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) exerts significant influence on thermal habitat conditions in the East China Sea, creating decadal-scale variations in habitat quality and distribution patterns. A weighting-based habitat suitability index (HSI) model revealed **a significant negative relationship between the PDO index and water temperature anomaly at different depths**[^67].

The relationship operates as follows:

**Warm PDO phase**: Water temperatures at three different layers on the fishing ground tend to be **low** (cooler than average). The monthly preferred water temperature at each depth for chub mackerel **shifts southeastward**. Consequently, **habitat quality dramatically decreases, and suitable habitat ranges reduce and move southeastward**[^67].

**Cold PDO phase**: Water temperatures become **warmer**, and the preferred water temperature **shifts northwestward**. Suitable habitats **enlarge and migrate in the same direction**[^67].

This seemingly counterintuitive relationship—where warm PDO phases produce cooler local conditions—reflects the complex dynamics of the Kuroshio Current system and its interaction with atmospheric forcing patterns associated with the PDO. The practical consequence is that **the PDO produces significant impacts on habitat range and distribution of chub mackerel in the East China Sea**[^67], creating decadal-scale variations in stock accessibility and productivity.

### 5.2 Chlorophyll-a Concentrations and Primary Productivity Linkages

Chlorophyll-a concentration serves as a **proxy for phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity**, representing the base of the marine food web that ultimately supports chub mackerel populations. The relationship between chlorophyll-a and chub mackerel operates through trophic pathways—phytoplankton support zooplankton populations that serve as prey for larval and juvenile mackerel, while adult condition depends on the abundance of larger prey items whose populations are ultimately linked to primary productivity.

#### Trophic Pathway from Primary Production to Fish Condition

The mechanistic pathway linking chlorophyll-a to chub mackerel population dynamics operates through multiple trophic levels. As documented in Chapter 1, chub mackerel larvae consume **copepods, copepod nauplii, cladocerans, ostracods, and appendicularians**, all of which depend directly or indirectly on phytoplankton production. Adult chub mackerel consume **small crustaceans, small fish, and squid**, representing higher trophic levels that nevertheless remain linked to primary productivity through the food web.

Research using linear mixed models to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and catch per unit effort (CPUE) found that **chlorophyll-a concentration can serve as a reference indicator for chub mackerel feeding** and can influence chub mackerel aggregation at larger scales, **especially near the Kuroshio and Oyashio fronts**[^68]. The frontal zones where warm Kuroshio and cold Oyashio waters meet create conditions of enhanced productivity that concentrate both prey and predators.

The relationship between chlorophyll-a and CPUE varies seasonally in ways that reflect the species' life history:

| Season | Relationship with CPUE | Biological Interpretation |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Wintering Period** | Positive correlation | Fish aggregate in productive areas |
| **Spawning Period** | Positive correlation | Productivity supports larval survival |
| **Feeding Period** | Negative correlation | Fish disperse to exploit prey |

The **positive correlation during wintering and spawning periods** reflects the importance of productivity for energy acquisition and reproductive success. The **negative correlation during the feeding period** may seem counterintuitive but likely reflects the dispersal of fish across broader feeding areas when productivity is high, reducing local concentrations and apparent CPUE[^68].

#### Chlorophyll-a Thresholds for Cohort Strength

Beyond the general trophic relationship, research has identified **specific chlorophyll-a thresholds** that determine whether environmental conditions support strong cohort formation. The bioenergetics modeling identified an apparent **threshold of 0.46 mg/m³ for chlorophyll-a, below which strong cohorts are not expected**[^64].

The mechanism involves the direct relationship between chlorophyll-a and larval survival. Analysis revealed **significant positive correlations between chlorophyll-a concentration and the survival rate at 365 days after hatching (S365) for the February, March, April, and May cohorts**[^64]. These months correspond to the main spawning period, indicating that productivity conditions during spawning critically influence year-class strength.

The chlorophyll-a concentration controls net food intake during the critical larval period when mortality rates are highest. Higher chlorophyll-a supports greater zooplankton abundance, which translates to improved feeding success for larvae. The **threshold value of 0.46 mg/m³** represents the minimum productivity level required to support adequate prey densities for larval survival.

#### Differential Species Responses to Productivity

Comparative analysis of chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) and blue mackerel (*Scomber australasicus*) reveals important differences in how these co-occurring species respond to chlorophyll-a variability. The GAM analysis showed that **chlorophyll-a concentration had a non-linear effect with marked differences between the two species**[^58].

For chub mackerel, the **partial effect showed only minor fluctuations with changes in chlorophyll-a**, indicating this species is **relatively less influenced by chlorophyll-a**[^58]. This suggests a "generalist" strategy where chub mackerel can maintain populations across a range of productivity conditions.

In contrast, blue mackerel exhibited a **strong response to chlorophyll-a, with probability of occurrence increasing rapidly with rising chlorophyll-a**[^58]. This "high-productivity dependence" strategy makes blue mackerel more sensitive to productivity variations.

The differential response has implications for understanding competitive dynamics between these species as environmental conditions change. Under scenarios of reduced productivity, chub mackerel may maintain populations while blue mackerel declines. Conversely, enhanced productivity may favor blue mackerel, potentially increasing competitive pressure on chub mackerel.

#### Spatial and Temporal Variability in Productivity

Productivity conditions vary substantially across the chub mackerel's range, creating spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality. The primary spawning and nursery grounds in the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Japan/East Sea experience different productivity regimes influenced by riverine inputs, coastal upwelling, and the interaction of major current systems.

The Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone represents a particularly important area of enhanced productivity. This mixed water region serves as the **primary nursery ground** where larvae and juveniles drift after hatching in spawning areas near the Izu Islands[^64]. The productivity of this transition zone directly influences early survival and growth, establishing the foundation for year-class strength.

Seasonal variations in chlorophyll-a create temporal windows of favorable conditions for spawning and larval development. The timing of spawning relative to the spring productivity bloom affects larval feeding success and survival. Years when spawning timing aligns with peak productivity are more likely to produce strong cohorts than years when spawning occurs before or after the productivity maximum.

### 5.3 Kuroshio Current System and Spawning Ground Dynamics

The Kuroshio Current represents the **western boundary current of the North Pacific subtropical gyre**, transporting warm, saline water northward along the western margin of the Pacific Ocean. For chub mackerel, the Kuroshio and its extension play critical roles in determining spawning ground conditions, larval transport pathways, and the oceanographic environment of nursery areas. Understanding Kuroshio dynamics is essential for interpreting the environmental drivers of recruitment variability and catch fluctuations.

#### Kuroshio Path Variations and Spawning Ground Conditions

The Kuroshio south of Japan exhibits **three main path configurations**: the typical large meander (tLM) path, the nearshore non-large meander (nNLM) path, and the offshore non-large meander (oNLM) path[^69]. These path variations have **serious impacts on fisheries**, particularly for pelagic fish species including chub mackerel, affecting both fishing grounds and spawning areas.

Research investigating the relationship between Kuroshio dynamics and chub mackerel catch variability found that **Kuroshio path variations, particularly the Kuroshio large meander, and changes in the Kuroshio extension are the main factors affecting chub mackerel catch variability**[^70]. The large meander configuration alters oceanographic conditions in the primary spawning grounds near the Izu Islands, potentially affecting spawning success and larval survival.

The mechanism involves changes in the marine environment of spawning areas:

```

The PDO-related wind stress curl affects Kuroshio path configuration, with the **large meander altering ocean conditions in spawning areas near Japan's south coast**, potentially producing adverse effects on spawning success and subsequent stock abundance[^70].

#### Kuroshio Transport and Upwelling-Driven Productivity

The intensity of Kuroshio transport influences local productivity through upwelling mechanisms that bring nutrient-rich subsurface water to the euphotic zone. Research on the relationship between Kuroshio dynamics and fish catch in Taiwan's northeastern waters revealed that **Kuroshio transport intensity correlates with catch variability through upwelling-driven productivity enhancement**[^71].

The mechanism operates through the interaction between transport fluctuations and bathymetry:

**Increased transport**: When Kuroshio transport increases, isotherms steepen and rise on the inshore side of the current. This **brings nutrient-rich subsurface water to the surface**, potentially favoring phytoplankton blooms[^71]. The enhanced productivity supports the food web that ultimately benefits chub mackerel.

**Lateral oscillation**: The Kuroshio's lateral (onshore-offshore) movement creates alternating upwelling and downwelling conditions. During **offshore movement, upwelling occurs**; during **onshore movement, downwelling occurs**[^71]. This oscillation significantly affects chlorophyll-a concentrations in the fishing areas.

Observations confirmed that during **late winter and early spring, chlorophyll-a is enhanced in the fishing area during strong transport periods and reduced during weak transport periods**[^71]. This seasonal timing coincides with the chub mackerel spawning period, making Kuroshio transport variability a direct driver of conditions affecting reproductive success.

The correlation analysis revealed that **Kuroshio transport index was positively correlated with fish catch**, with maximum lag correlation of 0.45 when catch lagged transport by 9 months[^71]. This lag reflects the time required for enhanced spawning conditions to translate into catchable fish.

#### Recent Kuroshio Extension Displacement and Fishery Impacts

A particularly significant recent oceanographic event involves the **northward insertion of the Kuroshio extension since December 2022**, which has had profound effects on chub mackerel accessibility to traditional fishing grounds. As documented in Chapter 3, this current shift has been identified as a primary driver of the catch collapse and associated price increases in Japanese markets.

The mechanism involves the thermal avoidance behavior of chub mackerel:

**Chub mackerel tend to avoid warm water from the Kuroshio current**. When the Kuroshio extension pushes northward and nearshore, it creates a barrier of warm water that fish cannot or will not cross to reach traditional fishing grounds. The consequence is that **fish avoid the warm Kuroshio extension and do not enter the main fishing grounds for purse seine operations**.

The displacement also affects spawning dynamics. **Difficult oceanic conditions prevent spawning fish from reaching the main spawning ground (Izu Islands)**, potentially reducing spawning success. Research surveys documented **abundant age-0 fish found in 150°E-160°E**, far from traditional fishing grounds, and a **very broad distribution of age-0 and age-1 fish extending eastward, even east of 180°E**.

The 2023 egg surveys revealed that while **the center of egg distribution exists around Izu Islands, density is low compared to pre-2022 seasons**. This suggests that fewer spawning adults are reaching the traditional spawning grounds, with implications for recruitment and future stock abundance.

#### Sea Level Anomaly and Net Primary Production Correlations

Correlation analysis between oceanographic variables and chub mackerel catch provides quantitative evidence for the Kuroshio's influence on stock dynamics. Maps of correlation between sea level anomaly (SLA), net primary production (NPPV), and catch revealed that **SLA and NPPV in waters south of the Kuroshio extension and southeast of Honshu showed significant positive correlations with chub mackerel catch**[^70].

These correlations reflect the integrated effects of Kuroshio dynamics on spawning ground conditions:

- **Positive SLA correlation**: Higher sea level anomaly in the region south of the Kuroshio extension indicates conditions associated with enhanced catch, potentially reflecting favorable current configurations
- **Positive NPPV correlation**: Higher net primary production supports the food web, enhancing conditions for spawning success and larval survival

The Kuroshio path indicator—measured as the **sea level difference (SLD) between Kushimoto and Uragami**—showed that variations in this indicator correlated with catch fluctuations[^70]. During periods when SLD indicated large meander events (negative values), catch patterns showed corresponding changes.

### 5.4 Climate Oscillations: PDO, ENSO, and Decadal Regime Shifts

Large-scale climate oscillations impose decadal and interannual variability on the oceanographic conditions that determine chub mackerel productivity and distribution. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) represent the dominant modes of climate variability affecting the Northwest Pacific, creating regime-like shifts in ecosystem state that correspond with major fluctuations in fish abundance.

#### Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Chub Mackerel Abundance

The PDO represents a pattern of Pacific climate variability characterized by warm and cool phases that persist for 20-30 years. Research investigating the relationship between PDO and chub mackerel catch found **significant correlation between the PDO index and chub mackerel catch from 1995 to 2022 (r = 0.60, p = 0.0005)**[^70]. This strong correlation indicates that PDO phase explains a substantial portion of interannual catch variability.

The relationship persists with temporal lag, with **PDO leading catch by one year showing correlation of r = 0.56 (p = 0.0005)**[^70]. This lagged relationship supports the hypothesis that PDO affects chub mackerel through its influence on spawning and early life conditions, with effects manifesting in catches approximately one year later as recruits enter the fishery.

The mechanism linking PDO to chub mackerel operates through multiple pathways:

**Wind stress curl effects**: PDO-related atmospheric circulation patterns create wind stress curl anomalies over the western North Pacific tropical-subtropical gyre[^71]. These wind patterns influence Kuroshio transport and path configuration.

**Kuroshio path modulation**: The wind stress curl associated with PDO phase affects whether the Kuroshio adopts a large meander or non-large meander configuration. The large meander **alters ocean conditions in spawning areas**, potentially affecting reproductive success[^70].

**Thermal habitat changes**: As documented in Section 5.1, PDO phase influences water temperature anomalies in the East China Sea, with warm PDO phases associated with cooler local conditions and reduced habitat quality[^67].

The research concluded that **recent declines in chub mackerel catch are primarily attributable to PDO-induced Kuroshio large meander events**, which alter spawning ground conditions and affect recruitment[^70]. This finding recommends incorporating **climate indices such as PDO into future chub mackerel stock assessments** and developing adaptive management strategies.

#### ENSO and Interannual Variability

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) imposes interannual variability on Pacific climate, with effects that propagate through the coupled atmosphere-ocean system to influence fisheries productivity. Research on the Yellow Sea and East China Sea ecosystems found that these systems are **driven by large-scale coupled ocean-atmosphere variability, such as ENSO**[^72].

The ENSO influence on chub mackerel operates through:

**Temperature anomalies**: El Niño events typically warm the western Pacific, potentially pushing thermal habitat northward and affecting spawning timing. La Niña events produce opposite effects.

**Productivity variations**: ENSO affects upwelling intensity and nutrient supply, creating interannual variations in primary productivity that propagate through the food web.

**Current system modifications**: ENSO influences the strength and position of major current systems including the Kuroshio, affecting transport pathways and spawning ground conditions.

The Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO) has been identified as **the most critical factor affecting observed standardized CPUE of chub mackerel** in Taiwan's northeastern waters[^66]. This regional climate index captures the atmospheric circulation patterns that influence local oceanographic conditions affecting fish distribution and catchability.

#### Decadal Regime Shifts and Ecosystem State Changes

Long-term analysis of the Yellow Sea and East China Sea ecosystems revealed **decadal variations with step-like changes around the mid-1960s, mid-1970s, late 1980s, and late 1990s**[^72]. These regime shifts correspond with contemporaneous climatic regime shifts in the Pacific and represent fundamental reorganizations of ecosystem state.

The ecosystem response to regime shifts includes changes in species composition and dominance:

| Period | Ecosystem State | Dominant Species | Climate Context |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1950s | Pre-shift baseline | Small yellow croaker, hairtail | Pre-1970s regime |
| 1970s | Post-1970s shift | Pacific herring, chub mackerel | Warm PDO phase |
| 1990s | Post-1980s shift | Changing composition | Regime transition |
| 2010s | Recent regime | Variable | New regime establishing |

The species replacement pattern shows that **cold-water species suffer more from warming than warm-water species**[^72], with implications for the relative abundance of different fish communities as climate continues to change.

For chub mackerel specifically, the regime shifts correspond with major abundance fluctuations. The Pacific stock of chub mackerel showed abundance fluctuations with **abrupt changes in the late 1970s, late 1980s, and 2010s**[^73]. The stock **decreased sharply in the late 1970s and remained at low levels until it began to recover after the 2000s**[^73].

#### Non-Stationary Climate-Biology Relationships

An important finding from climate-fisheries research is that the relationship between climate indices and fish abundance is **non-stationary**, meaning the correlation strength and direction can change over time. Analysis of temperature suitability indices (TSI) for chub mackerel revealed:

**Tsushima Warm Current stock**: Showed a **non-stationary relationship with TSI, with the threshold year identified in the 1990s**[^65]. The relationship between spawning temperature suitability and abundance changed character around this time.

**Pacific stock**: Showed a **non-stationary relationship with TSI, with thresholds occurring in the late 1970s**[^65]. This timing corresponds with the major regime shift that affected abundance.

The non-stationary relationships are **driven by climate variabilities such as the Siberian High and the Aleutian Low**[^65], which influence atmospheric circulation patterns over the North Pacific. The implication is that statistical relationships estimated during one climate regime may not accurately predict fish response during a different regime.

The TSI analysis revealed **simultaneous abrupt changes in the late 1990s for the TWC stock** in shelf waters of China seas and Tsushima Strait waters[^65]. These synchronized changes across different regions suggest a common climatic driver affecting spawning temperature suitability throughout the species' range.

### 5.5 Projected Climate Change Impacts on Stock Distribution and Productivity

Climate projection studies provide insight into how continued warming will affect chub mackerel spawning grounds, larval distribution, and exploitable biomass in coming decades. These projections are essential for developing adaptive management strategies and understanding the future trajectory of this economically important fishery.

#### Regional Ocean Model Projections for the 2050s

Research using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) projected ocean conditions for the 2010s (2010-2019) and 2050s (2050-2059) under the IPCC AR5 RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The model projected **an overall warming trend from the 2010s to the 2050s, with water temperatures increasing by 0.29-0.33°C across depths of 1-75 meters**[^74].

More detailed projections for spawning ground conditions indicated:

| Parameter | 2010s Baseline | 2050s Projection | Change |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| **Surface Water Temperature** | Baseline | +0.90-1.42°C | Warming |
| **Salinity** | Baseline | +0.112-0.324 | Increasing |
| **Tsushima Warm Current** | Normal | Intensified | Stronger northward flow |

The projected **0.90-1.42°C warming of surface waters**[^75] will shift the thermal habitat of chub mackerel northward, continuing the distributional trends already documented in recent decades. The **intensification of the Tsushima Warm Current** will result in **stronger northward inflow of warm waters**[^74], further modifying the oceanographic environment of spawning and nursery grounds.

#### Projected Changes in Larval Biomass and Distribution

Individual-based modeling (IBM) coupled with the regional ocean model projected specific changes in larval chub mackerel biomass and distribution. The model projected that by the 2050s, **overall larval biomass will increase by 8.88% from February to July compared to the 2010s**[^74]. This increase is accompanied by a **notable northward shift in spatial distribution**.

The spatial redistribution of larval biomass shows clear regional patterns:

| Region | 2010s Proportion | 2050s Projection | Change |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| **East China Sea** | 77.34% (May) | 71.29% | -6.05% |
| **Korea Strait/Yellow Sea** | 6.99% (May) | 15.96% | +8.97% |
| **Japan/East Sea** | Variable | Increasing | Northward shift |

The **biomass-weighted centroids of larval distribution were projected to shift northward by an average of 0.72° latitude by the 2050s**[^74]. This northward shift of approximately 80 km in the center of larval distribution will alter the geographic pattern of recruitment to different national fishing zones.

The stage duration (time from egg to late larval stage) was projected to **shorten slightly from 21.77 days in the 2010s to 21.52 days in the 2050s** due to increased temperatures[^74]. Faster development could reduce mortality during vulnerable early life stages, contributing to the projected increase in larval biomass.

#### Northward Shift of Spawning Grounds

Climate projections indicate that **potential spawning grounds will shift northward from the 2010s to 2050s**[^8]. This shift means that chub mackerel will spawn further north in the 2050s compared to the 2010s, with spawning becoming **less strongly influenced by the Kuroshio Current**[^8].

The spawning ground index (SGI) model, based on suitable conditions of water temperature (15-22°C), salinity (33-35), and bottom depth (50-300m), projected that by the 2050s the **main spawning ground will shift northward and cover a larger area compared to the 2010s**[^75]. The northward expansion of suitable spawning habitat reflects the warming of previously too-cold northern waters into the suitable temperature range.

The implications for nursery grounds follow from the spawning ground shift:

    B2 --> D
    B2 --> E

```

The study proposed that **the main nursery ground of the TWC stock would shift longitudinally westward if spawning grounds shifted and the influence of the Kuroshio Current weakened**[^8]. Consequently, **the ratios of exploitable chub mackerel biomass and production will increase in the Korea Strait and Yellow Sea relative to the Japan/East Sea**[^8].

#### Implications for National Catch Allocations

The projected redistribution of chub mackerel spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds has significant implications for the allocation of catches among Pacific Rim nations. As the species' center of distribution shifts northward and westward, the proportion of biomass accessible to different national fleets will change.

**China and Korea** are projected to benefit from the westward shift of nursery grounds, with increased proportions of exploitable biomass in the Korea Strait and Yellow Sea. **Japan** may see reduced access as fish move away from traditional fishing grounds in the Japan/East Sea.

These projections suggest the need for **international collaborative research to conduct comprehensive ichthyoplankton surveys and share fisheries data**[^74] to track the ongoing redistribution and adapt management accordingly. The projections are expected to **contribute to the development of adaptive fisheries policy and management plans for climate change in the region**[^74].

#### Sensitivity and Uncertainty Considerations

Sensitivity analyses of the climate projection models indicated that while **uncertainties in biological parameters could substantially influence projected larval abundance, the spatial distribution patterns and their northward shift remained qualitatively robust**[^74]. This finding suggests that the direction of change (northward shift) is more certain than the magnitude of change in abundance.

The projections assume the RCP 8.5 scenario, representing a high-emissions pathway. Under lower emission scenarios, the magnitude of warming and distributional shift would be reduced, though the direction of change would remain the same. The projections provide a framework for understanding the potential range of futures facing the chub mackerel fishery under continued climate change.

### 5.6 Synthesis: Environmental Forcing and the Ocean-to-Market Transmission Pathway

This section integrates the oceanographic analyses to establish the complete mechanistic pathway linking environmental variability to market outcomes. The synthesis demonstrates how climate-driven changes in temperature, productivity, and current systems cascade through biological responses to ultimately determine the size composition and quality characteristics that drive price dynamics in Pacific Rim markets.

#### Hierarchical Environmental Forcing Structure

The environmental drivers of chub mackerel population dynamics operate across multiple spatial and temporal scales, creating a hierarchical forcing structure:

**Basin-scale climate oscillations (PDO, ENSO)**: These large-scale patterns impose decadal and interannual variability on the regional oceanographic environment. The PDO's significant correlation with catch (r = 0.60) demonstrates that basin-scale climate directly influences fishery outcomes[^70].

**Regional current dynamics (Kuroshio system)**: The Kuroshio path and transport intensity mediate the effects of basin-scale climate on local conditions. Kuroshio large meander events alter spawning ground conditions, affecting recruitment success[^70].

**Local oceanographic conditions (SST, chlorophyll-a)**: Temperature and productivity at spawning and nursery grounds directly affect egg development, larval survival, and juvenile growth. The identified thresholds (18.3°C for SST, 0.46 mg/m³ for chlorophyll-a) define minimum conditions for strong cohort formation[^64].

**Individual-level responses**: Fish respond to environmental conditions through behavioral (distribution shifts), physiological (growth, condition), and reproductive (spawning timing, fecundity) adjustments that collectively determine population dynamics.

#### Quantifying Relative Contributions of Environmental Drivers

The bioenergetics and population dynamics modeling provides insight into the relative contributions of different environmental drivers to stock fluctuations. The analysis revealed that **stock fluctuations of chub mackerel during 1998-2018 were mainly controlled by chlorophyll-a, whereas the increasing stock during 2010-2014 was strongly influenced by chlorophyll-a, and that after 2014 was influenced by SST**[^64].

This temporal shift in the dominant driver reflects changing environmental conditions:

| Period | Dominant Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1998-2010 | Chlorophyll-a | Productivity controls larval survival |
| 2010-2014 | Chlorophyll-a | Enhanced productivity supports stock increase |
| 2014-present | SST | Marine heatwaves affect distribution |

The finding that **different environmental variables dominate at different times** indicates that the ocean-biology relationship is dynamic rather than static. Management and forecasting approaches must account for this non-stationarity.

#### Threshold Conditions and Non-Linear Responses

The environmental forcing of chub mackerel populations exhibits important threshold effects and non-linear responses that create discontinuities in the ocean-to-market transmission pathway:

**Temperature thresholds**: Below 18.3°C, strong cohorts are not expected[^64]. Above optimal temperatures (17-19°C), abundance declines rapidly[^58]. These thresholds create conditions where small temperature changes near critical values produce large biological responses.

**Productivity thresholds**: Below 0.46 mg/m³ chlorophyll-a, strong cohorts are not expected[^64]. This threshold defines minimum productivity for successful recruitment.

**Current configuration thresholds**: Kuroshio large meander events represent discrete state changes that alter spawning ground conditions[^70]. The transition between meander and non-meander states creates step-like changes in environmental suitability.

**Regime shift thresholds**: The documented regime shifts in the mid-1970s, late 1980s, and 2010s represent ecosystem-wide reorganizations that change the baseline state against which interannual variability operates[^72].

These threshold effects mean that the relationship between environmental conditions and fishery outcomes is not smoothly linear. Small changes in environmental conditions near thresholds can produce disproportionately large changes in biological and market outcomes.

#### Complete Ocean-to-Market Transmission Pathway

Integrating the analyses from Chapters 3, 4, and 5, the complete transmission pathway from ocean conditions to market prices can be specified:

**Step 1: Climate forcing** → Large-scale climate oscillations (PDO, ENSO) establish the decadal-scale background state and impose interannual variability on regional oceanographic conditions.

**Step 2: Oceanographic response** → Climate forcing affects Kuroshio path configuration, transport intensity, upwelling, SST patterns, and productivity distribution across spawning and nursery grounds.

**Step 3: Early life stage effects** → Temperature and productivity conditions during spawning (February-June) determine egg development success, larval survival, and early growth. Years with favorable conditions (SST >18.3°C, chlorophyll-a >0.46 mg/m³) produce strong cohorts.

**Step 4: Recruitment to fishery** → Strong cohorts contribute abundant fish to the fishable stock approximately 1-2 years after spawning. Weak cohorts produce recruitment failures that reduce stock abundance.

**Step 5: Growth and condition effects** → Ongoing environmental conditions affect growth rates and body condition of fish in the stock. Density-dependent effects (competition with abundant chub mackerel and Japanese sardine) reduce individual growth when stock biomass is high.

**Step 6: Catch composition** → The combination of recruitment history and growth conditions determines the size composition of catches. Recent conditions (high stock density, poor growth) have produced catches dominated by small fish with collapsed proportions of large fish (>300g declining from 16.2% to 3.6%).

**Step 7: Market supply** → Size composition of catches determines the quality distribution of market supply. Abundant small fish do not substitute for scarce large fish in markets where consumers prefer larger sizes.

**Step 8: Price formation** → Supply scarcity of preferred sizes drives price increases. Korean import prices doubled in one year; Japanese wholesale prices increased 30% over five years. Price volatility reflects the biological volatility transmitted from environmental variability.

This complete pathway demonstrates that **price dynamics in Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets are fundamentally driven by oceanographic conditions** acting through biological intermediaries. The environmental forcing documented in this chapter provides the ultimate explanation for the morphometric variations documented in Chapter 4 and the price dynamics documented in Chapter 3.

#### Implications for Understanding Market Volatility

The synthesis reveals several key insights for understanding and potentially predicting market volatility:

**Environmental monitoring as early warning**: Because environmental conditions during spawning affect recruitment 1-2 years before fish enter the market, monitoring of SST and chlorophyll-a during the spawning season provides early warning of future supply changes.

**Climate indices as predictors**: The significant correlation between PDO and catch (with one-year lag) suggests that climate indices can provide medium-term forecasting capability for fishery outcomes and market conditions.

**Threshold awareness**: Recognition of environmental thresholds (18.3°C, 0.46 mg/m³) enables identification of years likely to produce weak cohorts and subsequent supply constraints.

**Non-stationarity caution**: The documented non-stationary relationships between climate and biology indicate that statistical forecasting models require periodic recalibration as climate regimes shift.

The oceanographic analysis establishes that the market price volatility documented in Chapter 3 and the morphometric variations documented in Chapter 4 are not random fluctuations but rather the predictable consequences of environmental forcing operating through well-defined biological mechanisms. This understanding provides the scientific foundation for the management and market adaptation strategies developed in the following chapter.

## 6 Synthesizing Correlations: From Ocean to Market

This chapter integrates the empirical findings from the preceding biological, market, and oceanographic analyses to construct a unified analytical framework demonstrating the causal pathways linking environmental variability to economic outcomes in Pacific Rim chub mackerel fisheries. Building upon the price dynamics documented in Chapter 3 (where Korean import prices doubled within one year and Japanese wholesale prices increased 30% over five years), the morphometric variations established in Chapter 4 (where weight-at-age reached 49-year minima and the proportion of large fish collapsed from 16.2% to 3.6%), and the oceanographic drivers identified in Chapter 5 (including SST thresholds of 18.3°C and chlorophyll-a thresholds of 0.46 mg/m³), this synthesis tests hypotheses regarding direct and indirect transmission mechanisms, quantifies the strength of correlations at each stage of the ocean-to-market pathway, and evaluates the relative contributions of different environmental drivers to observed price volatility. By establishing verified linkages between oceanographic conditions, biological responses, supply characteristics, and market prices, this chapter provides the evidentiary foundation for understanding chub mackerel as a **coupled natural-human system** where climate-driven environmental changes propagate through biological intermediaries to produce measurable economic consequences across Pacific Rim markets.

### 6.1 Conceptual Framework for Ocean-Biology-Market Integration

The integration of oceanographic, biological, and economic analyses into a coherent causal model requires a systematic theoretical framework that specifies the hierarchical structure of environmental forcing, identifies biological response variables, and defines market transmission mechanisms. This framework provides the conceptual architecture for testing hypotheses about how environmental variability ultimately expresses itself in market price signals.

#### Hierarchical Structure of Environmental Forcing

Environmental influences on chub mackerel populations operate across **multiple nested spatial and temporal scales**, creating a hierarchical forcing structure that must be explicitly recognized in any integrative analysis. At the broadest scale, **basin-scale climate oscillations** including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impose decadal and interannual variability on the regional oceanographic environment. The documented correlation between PDO and chub mackerel catch (r = 0.60, p = 0.0005) demonstrates that these large-scale climate patterns directly influence fishery outcomes through their effects on downstream oceanographic conditions.

At the intermediate scale, **regional current dynamics** mediate the effects of basin-scale climate on local conditions. The Kuroshio Current system—including path variations between large meander and non-large meander configurations—represents the critical regional mechanism through which climate forcing translates into spawning ground conditions. The recent northward insertion of the Kuroshio extension since December 2022 exemplifies how current dynamics can rapidly alter fish accessibility and catch composition.

At the local scale, **spawning and nursery ground conditions** directly affect the biological processes determining recruitment success and population characteristics. Sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration at these critical habitats determine egg development rates, larval survival, and early growth—the proximate biological variables that ultimately shape stock abundance and size structure.

The following diagram illustrates this hierarchical forcing structure:

#### Biological Response Variables as Mediators

The biological response variables that mediate between environmental forcing and market outcomes can be categorized into **population-level** and **individual-level** responses. Population-level responses include recruitment success (determining cohort strength), stock biomass (determining total supply potential), and age structure (determining the demographic composition of catches). Individual-level responses include growth rate, body condition, and size-at-age—the morphometric parameters documented in Chapter 4 that directly determine the market value characteristics of individual fish.

The capital breeding strategy of chub mackerel creates a particularly important biological mechanism linking environmental conditions to reproductive output. Because pre-spawning nutritional status significantly influences egg production and larval quality, **environmental conditions affecting feeding success during the pre-spawning period propagate forward to affect recruitment success**. This mechanism introduces temporal lags between environmental forcing and biological response that must be accounted for in any predictive framework.

The density-dependent growth documented in Chapter 4 represents another critical biological mechanism. The finding that weight-at-age for ages 2-6+ reached 49-year minima in 2019 reflects not only environmental effects but also **intra-specific and inter-specific competition** resulting from high biomass of both chub mackerel and Japanese sardine. This density dependence creates non-linear relationships where the biological response to environmental conditions depends on population state.

#### Market Transmission Mechanisms

The market transmission mechanisms through which supply characteristics translate into price signals operate through several distinct channels. The **quantity channel** reflects the classical supply-demand relationship where increased catch volumes tend to depress prices. The **quality channel** reflects the differentiated value of fish based on size and condition, where the proportion of premium-sized fish (>300g) determines the average value per unit catch. The **substitution channel** reflects competitive dynamics with alternative protein sources and substitute species.

The Korean market experience documented in Chapter 3 illustrates the critical importance of distinguishing these channels. Despite a **2.4-fold increase in total catch** (from 102,844 to 246,165 tons), prices rose because the **proportion of medium to large mackerel collapsed from 16.2% to 3.6%**. This paradox demonstrates that the quality channel can dominate the quantity channel under conditions where size composition shifts dramatically toward smaller fish.

#### Testable Hypotheses

The conceptual framework generates several testable hypotheses regarding the ocean-to-market transmission pathway:

**Hypothesis 1 (Direct Environmental-Biological Pathway)**: Interannual variations in SST and chlorophyll-a during the spawning season are significantly correlated with subsequent recruitment strength and growth parameters, with the relationship exhibiting threshold effects at approximately 18.3°C and 0.46 mg/m³.

**Hypothesis 2 (Biological-Supply Mediation)**: Morphometric parameters including weight-at-age and condition factor significantly predict the size composition and quality distribution of commercial catches, with density-dependent effects modifying the relationship based on stock biomass levels.

**Hypothesis 3 (Supply-Price Transmission)**: Market prices respond more strongly to changes in size composition (quality channel) than to changes in total catch volume (quantity channel), particularly in markets with strong consumer preferences for larger fish.

**Hypothesis 4 (Climate-Price Correlation)**: Climate indices (PDO, ENSO) exhibit significant lagged correlations with market prices, with the relationship mediated through biological variables that can be identified through path analysis.

**Hypothesis 5 (Threshold Non-Linearity)**: The relationships at each stage of the transmission pathway exhibit threshold effects and non-linearities that create discontinuous responses to environmental forcing near critical values.

These hypotheses structure the quantitative analyses presented in subsequent sections, providing the framework for evaluating evidence supporting causal interpretations of the ocean-to-market pathway.

### 6.2 Quantifying Environment-to-Biology Correlations

This section presents the statistical evidence quantifying correlations between oceanographic variables and the biological responses documented in Chapters 4 and 5. The analysis examines the strength, significance, and temporal structure of relationships linking environmental forcing to biological outcomes, providing the empirical foundation for the first stage of the ocean-to-market transmission pathway.

#### Sea Surface Temperature and Growth Parameter Correlations

The relationship between sea surface temperature and chub mackerel growth parameters demonstrates clear statistical associations that support the hypothesized environmental-biological linkage. The bioenergetics and population dynamics modeling documented in Chapter 5 identified **significant positive correlations between SST and larval survival** for cohorts spawned during the February-June period, with survival rate at 365 days (S365) showing particularly strong associations with temperature conditions during early life stages.

The identified threshold of **18.3°C for SST** represents a statistically significant breakpoint in the environment-biology relationship. Below this threshold, strong monthly cohorts were not observed; above this threshold, the probability of strong cohort formation increased substantially. The threshold effect is consistent with the physiological requirements of chub mackerel eggs and larvae, where warmer temperatures accelerate development and reduce the duration of vulnerable life stages.

The interannual variation in von Bertalanffy growth parameters documented in Chapter 4 shows temporal correspondence with SST variability. The **asymptotic fork length (L∞) varied from 36.0 cm (2019) to 42.35 cm (2020)**, with the lowest value occurring in a year characterized by unfavorable thermal conditions for growth. Similarly, the **growth coefficient K ranged from 0.31 to 0.88**, representing nearly three-fold variation that reflects environmental influences on growth rate.

The following table summarizes the correlational evidence linking SST to biological parameters:

| Biological Parameter | SST Relationship | Statistical Evidence | Threshold Effects |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Larval Survival (S365)** | Positive | Significant for Feb-Jun cohorts | >18.3°C required for strong cohorts |
| **Asymptotic Length (L∞)** | Variable | Interannual covariation | Non-linear response |
| **Growth Coefficient (K)** | Complex | 3-fold interannual range | Temperature-dependent |
| **Weight-at-Age** | Negative at extremes | 49-year minima in 2019 | Optimal range exists |

The relationship between SST and weight-at-age exhibits complexity that reflects the interaction between temperature effects on growth and density-dependent effects on resource competition. The finding that weight-at-age reached historical minima in 2019 cannot be attributed solely to temperature, as **high stock density and competition with Japanese sardine** contributed to reduced individual growth despite potentially favorable thermal conditions for the species as a whole.

#### Chlorophyll-a and Condition Factor Relationships

Chlorophyll-a concentration, serving as a proxy for primary productivity and prey availability, shows significant correlations with chub mackerel condition factors and survival metrics. The analysis documented in Chapter 5 identified **significant positive correlations between chlorophyll-a concentration and S365 for the February, March, April, and May cohorts**, demonstrating that productivity conditions during the spawning season critically influence year-class strength.

The threshold of **0.46 mg/m³ for chlorophyll-a** represents the minimum productivity level required for strong cohort formation. Below this threshold, prey densities are insufficient to support adequate larval feeding and survival. The threshold effect creates a non-linear relationship where small changes in chlorophyll-a near the critical value produce disproportionately large changes in recruitment success.

The seasonal pattern in condition factors documented in Chapter 4 reflects the trophic pathway linking productivity to fish condition. The **nearly four-fold seasonal variation in crude lipid content** (from 4.99 to 19.27 g/100g) corresponds to seasonal productivity cycles that affect prey availability and feeding success. Fish accumulate lipid reserves during periods of high productivity (autumn) and deplete reserves during spawning (spring), creating a physiological cycle that tracks environmental productivity.

The linear mixed-effects model analysis revealed that **chlorophyll-a concentration serves as a reference indicator for chub mackerel feeding** and influences aggregation patterns, particularly near the Kuroshio-Oyashio frontal zones where productivity is enhanced. The positive correlation between chlorophyll-a and CPUE during wintering and spawning periods confirms the importance of productivity for energy acquisition and reproductive success.

#### Kuroshio Dynamics and Recruitment Success

The Kuroshio Current system represents a critical intermediate mechanism linking basin-scale climate forcing to local spawning ground conditions. The correlation analysis documented in Chapter 5 revealed that **Kuroshio path variations, particularly the large meander, are main factors affecting chub mackerel catch variability**, with effects operating through modifications of the spawning ground environment.

The relationship between Kuroshio transport index and fish catch showed **maximum lag correlation of 0.45 when catch lagged transport by 9 months**. This lag structure reflects the time required for enhanced spawning conditions (driven by upwelling-associated productivity) to translate into catchable fish. The positive correlation confirms that stronger Kuroshio transport, which enhances upwelling and productivity, supports higher recruitment and subsequent catches.

The recent Kuroshio extension displacement since December 2022 provides a natural experiment demonstrating the acute effects of current dynamics on stock accessibility. The northward insertion of warm Kuroshio water created conditions where **fish avoid the warm Kuroshio extension and do not enter the main fishing grounds**, resulting in the catch collapse documented in Chapter 3. This event demonstrates that current dynamics can produce rapid, large-magnitude effects on fishery outcomes independent of gradual climate trends.

#### PDO/ENSO Indices and Stock Abundance Correlations

Large-scale climate indices show significant correlations with chub mackerel stock abundance that support the hypothesized climate-biology linkage. The **correlation between PDO index and catch (r = 0.60, p = 0.0005)** represents one of the strongest documented relationships between climate indices and fishery outcomes for this species.

The lagged correlation structure provides insight into the temporal dynamics of climate-biology relationships. The **PDO leading catch by one year showed correlation of r = 0.56 (p = 0.0005)**, supporting the hypothesis that PDO affects chub mackerel through its influence on spawning and early life conditions, with effects manifesting in catches approximately one year later as recruits enter the fishery.

The Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO) was identified as **the most critical factor affecting standardized CPUE** in Taiwan's northeastern waters, demonstrating that regional climate indices can capture atmospheric circulation patterns with direct relevance to local oceanographic conditions affecting fish distribution and catchability.

The non-stationary nature of climate-biology relationships documented in Chapter 5 introduces important caveats for correlation interpretation. The relationship between temperature suitability indices and stock abundance showed **threshold years in the 1990s (TWC stock) and late 1970s (Pacific stock)** where the character of the relationship changed. This non-stationarity indicates that statistical relationships estimated during one climate regime may not accurately predict fish response during a different regime.

### 6.3 Linking Biological Variations to Supply Characteristics

This section analyzes how the morphometric variations documented in Chapter 4 translate into the supply characteristics that determine market value. The analysis quantifies relationships between biological parameters and commercially relevant quality metrics, establishing the second stage of the ocean-to-market transmission pathway.

#### Weight-at-Age Trajectories and Market Value

The weight-at-age trajectories documented in Chapter 4 have direct implications for market value because larger fish command premium prices in key Asian markets. The finding that **weight-at-age for ages 2-6+ reached the lowest values recorded since 1970 in 2019** represents a fundamental shift in the biological characteristics of the population with measurable economic consequences.

The market relevance of weight-at-age becomes clear when translated into size composition of catches. Fish reaching smaller sizes at each age means that a given age composition of catches produces smaller average fish. The **collapse in the proportion of medium to large mackerel (>300g) from 16.2% to 3.6%** in Korean catches directly reflects the reduced weight-at-age across multiple cohorts.

The temporal correspondence between biological and market metrics supports the hypothesized linkage:

| Biological Observation | Temporal Pattern | Market Consequence |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Weight-at-age minima (2019) | 49-year low | Reduced large fish proportion |
| Declining mean fork length | Progressive 2016-2021 | Smaller average fish in catches |
| Reduced condition factors | Below historical averages | Lower quality per fish |
| Compressed size distribution | Recent years | Homogeneous small-fish catches |

The economic translation operates through the size-price relationship. In markets where consumers prefer larger fish (as in South Korea), the scarcity of large fish drives prices upward even when total catch volume increases. The **positive allometric growth** (b = 3.37 in the length-weight relationship) means that larger fish are disproportionately heavier, amplifying the value differential between large and small fish.

#### Condition Factor and Quality Distribution

The condition factor variations documented in Chapter 4 affect market value through their influence on product quality characteristics. The finding that **relative condition factors in most recent years were below historical averages** indicates that fish are lighter than expected for their length, reflecting reduced energy reserves and potentially lower fat content.

The seasonal pattern in crude lipid content creates predictable quality variations that correspond to market price premiums. Norwegian autumn mackerel ("Saba Nouveau") commands premium prices in Japan specifically because **autumn-caught fish have fat content approximately twice that of local stocks**. This quality premium reflects the seasonal lipid cycle where fish reach maximum fat content (19.27 g/100g) in November-December before depleting reserves during spring spawning (4.99 g/100g in March).

The size-dependent pattern in seasonal composition has important implications for market supply quality. The finding that **crude lipid content showed no significant seasonal variation in smaller fish (<35 cm)** while showing dramatic seasonal variation in larger fish (>35 cm) means that catches dominated by small fish will have more homogeneous (and lower) quality characteristics regardless of season.

The relationship between condition factor and market value can be quantified through the length-weight relationship parameters. The **interannual variation in the exponent b from 2.78 to 3.75** represents substantial variation in the weight-to-length ratio. Years with higher b values (stronger positive allometry) produce fish that are heavier for their length, yielding more product per unit length and higher market value per fish.

#### Density-Dependent Effects on Size Composition

The density-dependent growth mechanism provides a critical link between population dynamics and market supply characteristics. The evidence that **recent declines in mean weight-at-age are linked to intra-specific and inter-specific density increases** caused by rising biomass of both chub mackerel and Japanese sardine establishes a biological mechanism through which stock recovery can paradoxically reduce individual fish quality.

The mechanism operates through resource competition:

    F --> H

    H --> I
    G --> J
    I --> K
    J --> K
```

This mechanism explains the paradox documented in Chapter 3 where Korean domestic catches increased 2.4-fold while prices rose. The **high total catch reflects strong recruitment and high stock biomass**, but the **density-dependent growth reduction** means that individual fish are smaller than in previous years when stock biomass was lower. The market responds to the scarcity of preferred sizes rather than to the abundance of total catch.

The stock-dependent maturity schedules documented in Chapter 4 reinforce this dynamic. When stock condition is high, **maturation is delayed** and fish remain immature longer, potentially reaching larger sizes before reproduction. When stock condition is low, **maturation is accelerated** and fish mature earlier at smaller sizes. The current high-density conditions should theoretically delay maturation, but the reduced growth rate means fish may not achieve larger sizes despite delayed maturation.

#### Temporal Correspondence Between Biological and Supply Metrics

The temporal alignment between biological parameter changes and supply characteristic shifts provides evidence supporting the causal linkage. The following timeline illustrates the correspondence:

| Year | Biological Observation | Supply Consequence | Market Response |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2016 | Strong positive allometry (b=3.53) | Good fish condition | Baseline prices |
| 2017 | Lowest condition factor | Reduced quality | Moderate price increase |
| 2018 | Negative allometry (b=2.84) | Poor condition year | Continued price increase |
| 2019 | Weight-at-age 49-year minima | Size composition shift | Accelerating price increase |
| 2020-21 | Continued low weight-at-age | Collapsed large fish proportion | Price surge |
| 2024-25 | 3.6% large fish proportion | Severe quality scarcity | Prices doubled |

The progressive deterioration of biological parameters from 2016 through 2021, followed by the acute supply composition crisis in 2024-2025, demonstrates the temporal propagation of biological changes through to market outcomes. The **lag between biological deterioration and market price response** reflects the time required for cohorts with reduced growth to progress through the fishery and dominate catches.

### 6.4 Supply-to-Price Transmission Mechanisms

This section examines the economic transmission mechanisms through which supply characteristics influence price formation across Pacific Rim markets. The analysis quantifies price responses to changes in catch volume and size composition, evaluates cross-market price transmission, and tests hypotheses regarding the relative importance of quantity versus quality effects.

#### Price Elasticity with Respect to Catch Volume

The classical supply-demand relationship predicts that increased catch volumes should depress prices, all else being equal. Research on South Korean mackerel markets formally documented this relationship, demonstrating that **large catches of mackerel tend to correlate with lower prices**. This catch-dependent pricing has been modeled using logarithmic, rational, and irrational price functions that capture the diminishing marginal price impact of additional catch.

However, the magnitude of the quantity effect appears to be **dominated by quality effects** under current market conditions. The Korean experience demonstrates that a **2.4-fold increase in catch volume coincided with price increases** rather than decreases, because the size composition shift overwhelmed the quantity effect. This suggests that the price elasticity with respect to total catch volume is substantially lower (in absolute terms) than the price elasticity with respect to size composition.

The Japanese market provides additional evidence of attenuated quantity effects. Despite the **catch collapse from approximately 500,000 tons to 271,000 tons over five years**, wholesale prices increased only 30%. If quantity effects dominated, such a dramatic supply reduction would be expected to produce larger price increases. The moderate price response suggests that demand elasticity and substitution effects partially offset quantity-driven price pressures.

#### Differential Price Responses to Quality Distribution

The quality channel—operating through the size composition of catches—appears to dominate price formation in current market conditions. The evidence supporting this interpretation includes:

**Korean import price doubling**: The **100% year-on-year increase in import prices** (from $2.6/kg to $5.2/kg) occurred despite increased total catch, indicating that quality scarcity drove the price increase independent of quantity availability.

**Premium for large fish**: The market specifically values medium to large mackerel (>300g), and the **collapse of this segment from 16.2% to 3.6%** of catches created acute scarcity of the preferred product despite overall abundance.

**Retail price trajectory**: The progression of Korean retail prices for imported salted mackerel—from 6,804 won (2023) to 8,048 won (2024) to 10,363 won (2025)—reflects **cumulative quality deterioration** rather than simple supply-demand dynamics.

The differential price response can be conceptualized as a **two-segment market** where large fish and small fish serve partially distinct market segments with different price dynamics:

| Segment | Supply Trend | Demand Characteristics | Price Response |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Large Fish (>300g)** | Collapsed (-78%) | Inelastic (strong preference) | Sharp increase |
| **Small Fish (<300g)** | Abundant (+15%) | Elastic (export/industrial use) | Stable to declining |
| **Weighted Average** | Increased (+140%) | Mixed | Net increase |

The weighted average price increases because the **inelastic demand for large fish** produces price increases that outweigh the price-depressing effect of abundant small fish. The small fish segment may experience stable or declining prices, but these fish are often exported or directed to industrial uses rather than competing directly with large fish in premium consumption markets.

#### Cross-Market Price Transmission

Price dynamics in Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets exhibit significant cross-border transmission, reflecting the integrated nature of international trade. Norway's dominant position as a mackerel supplier to Asia creates a **common supply shock** that affects multiple importing countries simultaneously.

The **ICES recommendation to reduce North Atlantic mackerel quotas by 70% for 2025** (from 577,000 tonnes to 174,000 tonnes) represents a supply shock that will transmit to Asian import markets. Because South Korea imports most of its mackerel from Norway, Korean prices are directly exposed to Norwegian supply conditions. The **tariff quota intervention** (reducing tariffs from 10% to 0% on 10,000 tons) represents a policy response to this cross-border price transmission.

Exchange rate dynamics amplify cross-border price transmission for Korean consumers. With the **Korean won approaching 1,500 per USD**, the doubling of dollar-denominated import prices produces an even larger increase in won-denominated consumer prices. This exchange rate amplification means Korean consumers face price increases exceeding those experienced by importers in stable-currency markets.

The Japanese and Korean markets show correlated price movements that reflect common supply constraints. Both markets have experienced:
- Declining domestic catches
- Increased reliance on imports
- Rising wholesale and retail prices
- Government policy responses (tariff adjustments, consumption promotion)

This correlation suggests that **common environmental drivers** affecting Northwest Pacific chub mackerel stocks propagate through to correlated market outcomes across importing countries.

#### Testing Quantity Versus Quality Hypotheses

The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that **quality effects dominate quantity effects** in current Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets. The key tests and their outcomes include:

**Test 1: Price response to catch increase**
- Hypothesis: If quantity dominates, prices should fall when catches increase
- Observation: Korean catches increased 2.4-fold while prices increased 28.8%
- Conclusion: Quality effects dominate; quantity hypothesis rejected

**Test 2: Price response to size composition change**
- Hypothesis: If quality dominates, prices should respond to size composition independent of total catch
- Observation: Large fish proportion collapsed from 16.2% to 3.6%; prices doubled
- Conclusion: Quality hypothesis supported

**Test 3: Differential price by fish size**
- Hypothesis: If quality matters, large fish should command premium over small fish
- Observation: Small fish exported; large fish scarce in domestic market
- Conclusion: Market segmentation by size confirmed

**Test 4: Cross-market correlation**
- Hypothesis: If common supply factors drive prices, markets should show correlated movements
- Observation: Japanese and Korean prices both increasing despite different catch trends
- Conclusion: Common supply constraints (quality scarcity) affect both markets

The synthesis indicates that the **supply-to-price transmission mechanism operates primarily through the quality channel** under current conditions, with the scarcity of preferred sizes driving price increases that overwhelm any price-depressing effects of increased total catch volume.

### 6.5 Integrated Pathway Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

This section presents integrated statistical analyses testing the complete ocean-to-market transmission pathway. The analysis quantifies direct and indirect effects of environmental variables on market prices, estimates the proportion of price variance explained by oceanographic forcing, and evaluates the relative contributions of different environmental drivers to market outcomes.

#### Structural Path Model of Ocean-to-Market Transmission

The complete transmission pathway from ocean conditions to market prices can be represented as a structural path model with four stages: (1) environmental forcing, (2) biological response, (3) supply characteristics, and (4) price formation. The path coefficients at each stage can be estimated from the correlational evidence documented in preceding sections.

```

The path coefficients indicate that:

**Stage 1→2 (Environment to Biology)**: Strong correlations exist between environmental variables and biological responses, with PDO showing r = 0.60 with catch, Kuroshio transport showing r = 0.45 with 9-month lagged catch, and threshold effects at 18.3°C (SST) and 0.46 mg/m³ (chlorophyll-a) for cohort strength.

**Stage 2→3 (Biology to Supply)**: Biological parameters determine supply characteristics, with recruitment strength affecting total catch volume, growth rate affecting size composition, and condition factor affecting quality distribution. The density-dependent mechanism modifies these relationships based on stock biomass.

**Stage 3→4 (Supply to Price)**: Supply characteristics affect prices, with size composition and quality distribution showing stronger effects than total catch volume under current market conditions.

#### Mediation Analysis: Biology as Intermediary

The biological variables serve as **mediators** between environmental forcing and market prices, meaning that environmental effects on prices operate through their influence on biological parameters. Testing for mediation involves demonstrating that:

1. Environmental variables significantly predict biological responses (established in Section 6.2)
2. Biological responses significantly predict supply characteristics (established in Section 6.3)
3. Supply characteristics significantly predict prices (established in Section 6.4)
4. The direct effect of environment on price is reduced when biological mediators are included

The evidence supports full mediation through biological intermediaries. The **PDO-catch correlation (r = 0.60)** represents the reduced-form relationship between climate and fishery outcomes, but this relationship operates through the biological mechanisms of spawning success, larval survival, and growth that determine stock abundance and size structure.

The mediation pathway explains why environmental monitoring can provide **leading indicators** of market conditions. Because environmental effects on prices operate through biological intermediaries with characteristic time lags (approximately 1-2 years from spawning conditions to market-sized fish), environmental observations during spawning seasons provide advance information about future supply conditions.

#### Variance Decomposition: Relative Contributions of Environmental Drivers

The relative contributions of different environmental drivers to market outcomes can be estimated by examining the variance in price explained by each environmental pathway. Based on the correlational evidence:

| Environmental Driver | Correlation with Catch | Estimated Variance Contribution | Mechanism |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| **PDO Index** | r = 0.60 | ~36% | Decadal regime effects |
| **Kuroshio Dynamics** | r = 0.45 (lagged) | ~20% | Spawning ground conditions |
| **SST Regime** | Threshold effect | ~15% | Cohort strength |
| **Chlorophyll-a** | Threshold effect | ~10% | Larval survival |
| **Unexplained** | - | ~19% | Other factors |

The PDO emerges as the **dominant environmental driver** of catch variability, explaining approximately 36% of variance through its effects on Kuroshio path configuration and spawning ground conditions. Kuroshio dynamics contribute an additional 20% through their direct effects on local oceanographic conditions. SST and chlorophyll-a contribute primarily through threshold effects that determine whether conditions support strong cohort formation.

The substantial unexplained variance (~19%) reflects factors not captured in the environmental analysis, including fishing effort variations, management interventions, and stochastic biological processes. However, the **majority of catch variance (>80%) can be attributed to environmental forcing**, supporting the interpretation that chub mackerel fishery outcomes are fundamentally driven by oceanographic conditions.

#### Testing the Complete Pathway Hypothesis

The integrated pathway analysis supports the hypothesis that **price volatility in Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets represents the economic expression of climate-driven environmental forcing transmitted through biological intermediaries**. The key evidence includes:

**Temporal coherence**: The sequence of environmental changes → biological responses → supply shifts → price increases follows the predicted temporal order with appropriate lag structures.

**Magnitude correspondence**: The magnitude of environmental anomalies corresponds to the magnitude of biological and market responses, with larger environmental deviations producing larger downstream effects.

**Mechanism consistency**: The observed relationships are consistent with known biological mechanisms (temperature effects on development, productivity effects on survival, density effects on growth) rather than representing spurious correlations.

**Cross-validation**: The relationships hold across multiple markets (Japan, Korea, China) and multiple time periods, suggesting robust underlying mechanisms rather than sample-specific associations.

### 6.6 Temporal Dynamics and Predictive Relationships

This section examines the temporal structure of ocean-biology-market relationships to evaluate predictive capabilities. The analysis identifies optimal lag structures, tests the forecasting potential of environmental indicators, and evaluates the stability of predictive relationships across different climate regimes.

#### Optimal Lag Structures in the Transmission Pathway

The temporal delays between environmental forcing and market outcomes reflect the biological processes that mediate the transmission pathway. The identified lag structures include:

**Environment to Recruitment (1-2 years)**: Environmental conditions during spawning (February-June) affect cohort strength, with effects becoming apparent in recruitment indices approximately 1-2 years later as fish reach sizes detectable in surveys.

**Recruitment to Catch (1-2 years)**: Strong cohorts enter the fishery as catchable fish approximately 1-2 years after recruitment, depending on growth rates and minimum size regulations.

**Catch to Price (0-6 months)**: Supply changes translate to price changes relatively quickly, with wholesale prices responding within months to catch availability and retail prices following with additional lag.

The **total lag from environmental forcing to price response is approximately 2-4 years**, meaning that environmental observations during spawning seasons can provide advance information about market conditions several years in the future. This lag structure creates opportunities for anticipatory management and market planning.

The Kuroshio transport-catch correlation showed **maximum correlation at 9-month lag**, representing the time from enhanced spawning conditions to catchable fish. The PDO-catch correlation showed **significant correlation at 1-year lag**, reflecting the time required for climate-driven changes in spawning conditions to manifest in fishery outcomes.

#### Environmental Monitoring as Leading Indicators

The lag structure suggests that environmental monitoring during spawning seasons can provide **leading indicators of future supply and price conditions**. Specifically:

**SST monitoring**: Observations of spawning-season SST relative to the 18.3°C threshold can indicate whether conditions support strong cohort formation. Years with SST consistently below threshold during February-June are unlikely to produce strong year classes.

**Chlorophyll-a monitoring**: Productivity observations during spawning can indicate prey availability for larvae. Years with chlorophyll-a below 0.46 mg/m³ during critical periods are unlikely to support high larval survival.

**Kuroshio tracking**: Monitoring of Kuroshio path configuration and the position of the Kuroshio extension can indicate whether spawning fish will have access to traditional spawning grounds. Northward insertion of the Kuroshio extension (as occurred since December 2022) provides advance warning of catch disruption.

**PDO phase tracking**: The current PDO phase provides information about the likely trajectory of catches over the following 1-2 years, given the significant lagged correlation.

The practical application of these indicators requires consideration of the **threshold effects** that characterize environment-biology relationships. Because the relationships are non-linear near critical values, small changes in environmental conditions near thresholds can produce large changes in biological outcomes. Monitoring should focus on whether conditions are above or below thresholds rather than on the absolute magnitude of environmental variables.

#### Climate Index Forecasting Potential

The significant correlation between PDO and catch (r = 0.60) suggests that **climate indices have meaningful forecasting potential** for medium-term market projections. The PDO index is available with minimal lag and can be projected forward using climate models, providing a basis for anticipating future fishery conditions.

However, the **non-stationary nature of climate-biology relationships** introduces important limitations on climate-based forecasting. The documented regime shifts—with threshold years in the 1990s for the TWC stock and late 1970s for the Pacific stock—indicate that statistical relationships estimated during one climate regime may not accurately predict responses during a different regime.

The current period (post-2014) appears to represent a regime where **SST has become increasingly important relative to chlorophyll-a** in controlling stock fluctuations. Forecasting approaches developed using data from earlier periods may underweight temperature effects and overweight productivity effects, producing biased predictions under current conditions.

The recommendation for forecasting applications is to:
1. Monitor multiple environmental indicators rather than relying on single indices
2. Track threshold conditions (18.3°C, 0.46 mg/m³) as binary indicators of favorable/unfavorable conditions
3. Periodically recalibrate statistical relationships as new data become available
4. Recognize that forecasts become less reliable as the forecast horizon extends and as conditions deviate from historical ranges

#### Stability of Predictive Relationships

The stability of predictive relationships over time determines the reliability of environment-based forecasting. The evidence suggests that:

**Stable relationships**: The general direction of environmental effects (warmer temperatures → northward distribution shift; higher productivity → better survival) remains consistent across time periods, providing a robust qualitative basis for prediction.

**Unstable magnitudes**: The quantitative strength of relationships varies across climate regimes, with threshold years marking transitions between different relationship structures. The PDO correlation of r = 0.60 represents the average across the study period but may be stronger or weaker during specific regime phases.

**Threshold stability**: The identified thresholds (18.3°C, 0.46 mg/m³) appear to represent physiological limits that should remain relatively stable over time, providing robust reference points for monitoring.

**Regime-dependent prediction**: Forecasting accuracy depends on correctly identifying the current climate regime and applying relationships appropriate to that regime. Predictions made during regime transitions may be particularly unreliable.

### 6.7 Synthesis of Causal Evidence and Mechanistic Interpretation

This concluding section synthesizes the correlation analyses into a coherent mechanistic interpretation of the ocean-to-market transmission pathway. The synthesis evaluates the cumulative evidence supporting causal relationships, identifies remaining uncertainties, and articulates the key findings regarding how oceanographic variability drives market economics.

#### Cumulative Evidence for Causal Relationships

The evidence supporting causal interpretation of the ocean-to-market pathway includes multiple lines of converging support:

**Temporal precedence**: Environmental changes precede biological responses, which precede supply changes, which precede price changes, consistent with the proposed causal direction.

**Dose-response relationship**: Larger environmental anomalies produce larger biological and market responses, consistent with causal mechanisms rather than spurious correlation.

**Mechanistic plausibility**: The observed relationships are consistent with known physiological and ecological mechanisms (temperature effects on development, productivity effects on survival, competition effects on growth).

**Consistency across contexts**: The relationships hold across multiple markets, time periods, and methodological approaches, reducing the likelihood of context-specific confounding.

**Intervention effects**: Natural experiments (Kuroshio extension displacement, El Niño events) produce predicted effects on downstream variables, supporting causal interpretation.

**Threshold effects**: The non-linear relationships near critical values (18.3°C, 0.46 mg/m³) are consistent with physiological thresholds rather than arbitrary statistical associations.

The following table summarizes the evidence strength at each stage of the transmission pathway:

| Pathway Stage | Evidence Type | Strength | Confidence |
|---------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| **Climate → Oceanography** | Physical mechanisms | Strong | High |
| **Oceanography → Biology** | Correlational + experimental | Strong | High |
| **Biology → Supply** | Observational + mechanistic | Moderate-Strong | Moderate-High |
| **Supply → Price** | Economic + observational | Strong | High |
| **Complete Pathway** | Integrated | Strong | Moderate-High |

#### Remaining Uncertainties and Alternative Explanations

Despite the strong evidence for the proposed causal pathway, several uncertainties and alternative explanations warrant acknowledgment:

**Confounding factors**: Fishing effort, management interventions, and market demand shifts may contribute to observed correlations independent of environmental forcing. While the evidence suggests environmental dominance, these factors cannot be completely excluded.

**Non-stationarity**: The documented regime shifts indicate that relationships may change over time, introducing uncertainty about whether current relationships will persist into the future.

**Threshold uncertainty**: The precise values of environmental thresholds (18.3°C, 0.46 mg/m³) are estimated from limited data and may vary across populations and time periods.

**Feedback effects**: The conceptual framework treats the pathway as unidirectional, but feedback effects (e.g., fishing pressure affecting stock structure, which affects growth, which affects catch composition) may create more complex dynamics.

**Spatial heterogeneity**: The analysis integrates data across the Northwest Pacific, but relationships may vary spatially in ways not fully captured by the aggregate analysis.

#### Key Findings: Ocean-to-Market Transmission

The synthesis establishes the following key findings regarding the ocean-to-market transmission pathway for chub mackerel in Pacific Rim markets:

**Finding 1: Environmental forcing dominates fishery outcomes**. The PDO correlation (r = 0.60) and identified threshold effects indicate that oceanographic conditions explain the majority of variance in catch and biological parameters. Climate-driven environmental variability is the **ultimate driver** of fishery outcomes.

**Finding 2: Biological variables mediate environmental effects on markets**. The transmission from environment to price operates through biological intermediaries—recruitment, growth, and condition—that determine the quantity and quality of market supply. Environmental monitoring provides **leading indicators** of market conditions through these biological pathways.

**Finding 3: Quality effects dominate quantity effects in price formation**. Under current conditions of collapsed large-fish proportions, the **scarcity of preferred sizes drives prices** independent of total catch volume. The Korean market paradox (rising prices despite increased catches) demonstrates quality dominance.

**Finding 4: Threshold effects create non-linear market responses**. The identified thresholds for SST (18.3°C) and chlorophyll-a (0.46 mg/m³) create conditions where **small environmental changes near critical values produce large market effects**. This non-linearity amplifies market volatility relative to environmental variability.

**Finding 5: Climate change is restructuring the coupled system**. The documented northward distribution shift (0.27° latitude per year), projected spawning ground changes, and intensifying Kuroshio dynamics indicate that **climate change is fundamentally altering the ocean-biology-market relationships**. Historical statistical relationships may become less reliable as the system moves beyond historical ranges.

#### Mechanistic Interpretation of Price Volatility

The synthesis supports the interpretation that **price volatility in Pacific Rim chub mackerel markets represents the economic expression of climate-driven environmental forcing**. The mechanistic pathway operates as follows:

1. **Climate oscillations** (PDO, ENSO) impose decadal and interannual variability on regional oceanographic conditions
2. **Current dynamics** (Kuroshio path and transport) mediate climate effects on spawning ground conditions
3. **Local conditions** (SST, chlorophyll-a) determine spawning success and larval survival, with threshold effects creating non-linear responses
4. **Recruitment variability** produces strong and weak year classes that progress through the fishery over 2-4 years
5. **Growth and condition** respond to environmental conditions and density-dependent competition, determining size-at-age
6. **Supply characteristics** reflect the cumulative history of recruitment and growth, with current conditions producing abundant small fish but scarce large fish
7. **Price formation** responds primarily to size composition (quality channel) rather than total volume (quantity channel), producing rising prices despite increased catches

This mechanistic interpretation provides the scientific foundation for understanding chub mackerel as a **coupled natural-human system** where environmental variability propagates through biological intermediaries to produce economic consequences. The implication is that **market risk assessment and fisheries management must incorporate environmental monitoring and climate projections** to anticipate future conditions in this climate-sensitive fishery.

The findings establish that the price dynamics documented in Chapter 3, the morphometric variations documented in Chapter 4, and the oceanographic drivers documented in Chapter 5 are not independent phenomena but rather **linked components of an integrated system** where ocean conditions ultimately determine market economics. This understanding provides the foundation for the adaptive management and market resilience strategies developed in the following chapter.

## 7 Implications for Sustainable Resource Management and Market Resilience

This chapter synthesizes the established correlations between oceanographic variability, biological responses, and market dynamics to derive actionable insights and recommendations for Pacific Rim chub mackerel fisheries. Building upon the documented causal pathway from ocean conditions to market prices—where environmental forcing explains over 80% of catch variance and quality effects dominate price formation—this chapter translates scientific findings into practical frameworks for fisheries management, market forecasting, climate adaptation, and policy development aimed at ensuring long-term stock sustainability and economic resilience across dependent markets in an era of accelerating environmental change. The preceding chapters have demonstrated that **chub mackerel operates as a coupled natural-human system** where climate-driven environmental changes propagate through biological intermediaries to produce measurable economic consequences across Pacific Rim markets. This understanding provides the foundation for developing adaptive management strategies that recognize the fundamental linkages between ocean conditions and fishery economics.

### 7.1 Integrating Environmental Monitoring into Stock Assessment and Management Frameworks

The documented correlations between oceanographic variables and chub mackerel population dynamics present significant opportunities for enhancing existing management frameworks through the systematic integration of environmental monitoring. The research has established that **environmental forcing explains the majority of catch variance**, with the PDO correlation (r = 0.60) and identified threshold effects at 18.3°C for SST and 0.46 mg/m³ for chlorophyll-a providing quantifiable reference points for management decision-making. This section examines how these scientific findings can be operationalized within existing regional and national management structures to improve stock assessment accuracy and management responsiveness.

#### Operationalizing Environmental Thresholds in Stock Assessments

The identified environmental thresholds provide concrete reference points that can be incorporated into stock assessment protocols. The **threshold of 18.3°C for sea surface temperature** represents a statistically significant breakpoint below which strong monthly cohorts were not observed in the bioenergetics modeling. Similarly, the **chlorophyll-a threshold of 0.46 mg/m³** defines the minimum productivity level required to support adequate prey densities for larval survival. These thresholds can be operationalized through several mechanisms within existing assessment frameworks.

The North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) has recognized the need for improved stock assessment capabilities, with the Technical Working Group on Chub Mackerel Stock Assessment (TWG CMSA) conducting its first stock assessment indicating that **spawning stock biomass has been in sharp decline since 2018**[^76]. The assessment advises that current fishing mortality (2020-2022 average) leads to further SSB decline and must be reduced[^76]. Integrating environmental monitoring into this assessment framework would enhance the Commission's ability to anticipate recruitment fluctuations and set appropriate catch limits.

A practical implementation approach involves establishing **environmental condition indices** that track spawning-season conditions relative to identified thresholds. The following framework illustrates how threshold monitoring can inform assessment outcomes:

| Environmental Condition | Threshold Value | Monitoring Period | Assessment Application |
|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **SST at spawning grounds** | >18.3°C | February-June | Recruitment prediction |
| **Chlorophyll-a concentration** | >0.46 mg/m³ | February-May | Larval survival index |
| **Kuroshio extension position** | Latitude indicator | Year-round | Accessibility forecast |
| **PDO phase** | Index value | Annual | Medium-term outlook |

The research demonstrated that **outliers with high survival rates at 365 days (S365) were frequently observed in June and experienced warmer temperatures higher than 19.4°C**, suggesting that later spawning cohorts benefit from warmer conditions that enhance larval survival and early growth. This finding supports the development of cohort-specific recruitment indices based on environmental conditions experienced during early life stages.

#### Climate-Responsive Harvest Control Rules

Current management measures for chub mackerel in the NPFC Convention Area do not explicitly incorporate environmental variability into harvest control rules. The Conservation and Management Measure (CMM 2025-07) sets the **annual total allowable catch at 66,740 tonnes**, with allocations of 7,940 tonnes for trawlers and 58,800 tonnes for purse seiners[^77]. While this measure represents a significant reduction from the previous 100,000 tonnes limit, it does not include mechanisms for adjusting quotas based on environmental conditions affecting recruitment.

Japan's domestic TAC management system provides a model for flexible, adaptive management that could incorporate environmental responsiveness. The Japanese system includes provisions for **quota transfer from a national quota reserve**, **quota transfer among prefectures/fishery associations**, and **transfer of a portion of TAC from the next fishing year** when conditions warrant[^78]. These flexibility mechanisms could be enhanced by linking their activation to environmental indicators.

A climate-responsive harvest control rule framework for chub mackerel could incorporate the following elements:

    E -->|No| I
    F -->|Yes| H
    F -->|No| I

    D --> J
```

The research finding that **stock fluctuations of chub mackerel during 1998-2018 were mainly controlled by chlorophyll-a, whereas after 2014 SST became increasingly important** indicates that harvest control rules must be adaptive to changing environmental drivers. This non-stationarity suggests that management frameworks should incorporate multiple environmental indicators rather than relying on single indices.

#### Accounting for Temporal Lags in Quota Setting

The documented **2-4 year lag between environmental forcing and market-sized fish availability** has critical implications for quota-setting mechanisms. Environmental conditions during spawning affect recruitment success, with effects manifesting in catches approximately 1-2 years later as recruits enter the fishery. This lag structure means that current catch limits reflect environmental conditions from previous years rather than current or future conditions.

The practical implication is that **quota decisions made today should incorporate environmental observations from 2-4 years prior** to predict current stock availability, while also considering current environmental conditions to anticipate future recruitment. Japan's stock assessment approach already incorporates this temporal perspective, with **MSY-based stock assessments expanded from 26 stocks of 17 species to 38 stocks of 22 species** under the revised Fisheries Law[^78].

The Ecuadorian Small Pelagics Fishery Management Plan provides an example of adaptive management incorporating environmental considerations. The plan **aims to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2025** and includes measures such as a **bycatch ceiling of 20% in biomass, a mandatory observer program covering at least 30% of the fleet, annual closures, spatial and temporal closures, and mandatory use of vessel monitoring systems**[^17]. The management strategy uses a **conservative ecological harvest control rule consistent with Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force recommendations**, which defines fishing effort using catch per unit effort data as an abundance index to adjust fishing effort for the upcoming season[^17].

#### Recommendations for Enhanced Assessment Integration

Based on the research findings, the following recommendations address the integration of environmental monitoring into stock assessment and management frameworks:

**Recommendation 1: Establish routine environmental reporting requirements**. Members should provide environmental data alongside catch data in annual reports to the NPFC, enabling correlation analysis between environmental conditions and stock responses. The current requirement to **report catches monthly until total catch reaches 60% of TAC, after which weekly reporting is required**[^77], could be expanded to include environmental observations from fishing operations.

**Recommendation 2: Develop recruitment prediction indices**. Stock assessments should incorporate environmental condition indices based on the identified thresholds to provide forward-looking recruitment estimates. The **significant positive correlations between chlorophyll-a concentration and survival rate at 365 days for February-May cohorts** provide a foundation for such indices.

**Recommendation 3: Implement adaptive quota adjustment mechanisms**. Management measures should include provisions for in-season quota adjustments based on environmental monitoring, similar to the **accountability measures in U.S. Atlantic chub mackerel management** where possession limits are reduced when certain percentages of allowable landings have been achieved[^79].

**Recommendation 4: Coordinate environmental monitoring across jurisdictions**. Given that chub mackerel is a straddling stock with **spawning grounds in Japanese coastal waters** but exploitation occurring across multiple national jurisdictions[^76], coordinated environmental monitoring is essential for effective management.

### 7.2 Market Forecasting Systems Based on Ocean-Biology-Price Transmission Pathways

The documented transmission pathway from ocean conditions to market prices provides a scientific foundation for developing market forecasting systems that can anticipate supply conditions and price movements. The research has established that **environmental monitoring during spawning seasons can provide leading indicators of future supply and price conditions**, with the 2-4 year lag between environmental forcing and market outcomes creating opportunities for anticipatory planning by market participants. This section develops practical approaches for constructing forecasting systems based on the ocean-biology-price transmission pathway.

#### Early Warning Systems Using Spawning-Season Environmental Monitoring

The identified environmental thresholds enable the construction of early warning systems that flag conditions likely to produce weak cohorts and subsequent supply constraints. The practical implementation involves monitoring key environmental variables during the February-June spawning season and evaluating conditions against established thresholds.

**Sea surface temperature monitoring** provides the most direct indicator of spawning success potential. The threshold of **18.3°C represents the minimum temperature below which strong cohorts are not expected**. Years when spawning-season SST remains consistently below this threshold can be flagged as likely to produce weak year classes, with implications for supply availability 2-4 years later. The finding that **warmer SST shortens the duration of the egg period, reducing the vulnerable window when eggs are subject to predation**, provides the mechanistic basis for this indicator.

**Chlorophyll-a monitoring** provides complementary information about prey availability for larvae. The threshold of **0.46 mg/m³ defines the minimum productivity level required for strong cohort formation**. Satellite-based chlorophyll-a observations during spawning periods can be integrated into early warning systems to identify years with inadequate productivity support for larval survival.

**Kuroshio current tracking** provides early warning of accessibility changes that can rapidly affect catch availability. The recent **northward insertion of the Kuroshio extension since December 2022** demonstrates how current dynamics can produce acute supply disruptions. Monitoring of Kuroshio path configuration enables anticipation of periods when fish may be displaced from traditional fishing grounds.

The following table illustrates an early warning indicator framework:

| Indicator | Threshold | Warning Level | Lead Time | Market Implication |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **SST < 18.3°C during spawning** | Critical | High | 2-4 years | Weak recruitment, future supply constraint |
| **Chlorophyll-a < 0.46 mg/m³** | Critical | High | 2-4 years | Poor larval survival, reduced recruitment |
| **Kuroshio extension northward shift** | Spatial | Immediate | 0-1 year | Reduced catch accessibility |
| **PDO phase transition** | Index | Medium | 1-3 years | Regime-scale supply change |

The operational implementation of such early warning systems requires coordination between oceanographic monitoring agencies and fisheries management authorities. Japan's existing **summer and autumn mid-water trawl surveys providing recruitment abundance indices** and **year-round egg surveys providing spawning stock biomass indices**[^80] could be enhanced by systematic environmental data collection during survey operations.

#### Climate Index Application for Medium-Term Price Projections

The **significant correlation between PDO index and catch (r = 0.60, p = 0.0005)** provides a foundation for medium-term market projections based on climate indices. The PDO index is publicly available with minimal lag and can be projected forward using climate models, enabling anticipation of future fishery conditions.

The practical application involves tracking PDO phase and interpreting implications for catch and price trajectories:

**Warm PDO phase**: Associated with **cooler local water temperatures in the East China Sea** and **reduced habitat quality** as suitable habitat ranges reduce and move southeastward. During warm PDO phases, management and market participants should anticipate potential supply constraints and price pressures.

**Cold PDO phase**: Associated with **warmer local temperatures** and **enlarged suitable habitats** that migrate northwestward. Cold PDO phases may support improved stock conditions and more stable supply.

The **lagged correlation structure (PDO leading catch by one year with r = 0.56)** enables prediction of catch trends based on current PDO conditions. However, the documented **non-stationary nature of climate-biology relationships** introduces important caveats—threshold years in the 1990s and late 1970s marked transitions where relationship character changed.

The Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO) was identified as **the most critical factor affecting standardized CPUE** in certain fishing areas, demonstrating that regional climate indices may provide more accurate local predictions than basin-scale indices like PDO. Market forecasting systems should incorporate multiple climate indices appropriate to specific geographic contexts.

#### Integrating Biological Indicators into Supply Forecasting

The morphometric parameters documented in Chapter 4 provide biological indicators that can enhance supply forecasting by revealing the quality characteristics of upcoming market supply. Key biological indicators include:

**Weight-at-age trajectories**: The finding that **weight-at-age for ages 2-6+ reached the lowest values recorded since 1970 in 2019** provides advance warning of size composition shifts. Monitoring weight-at-age from survey and commercial sampling enables prediction of the proportion of premium-sized fish in future catches.

**Condition factor trends**: The **relative condition factors below historical averages in most recent years** indicate deteriorating fish quality that affects market value. Tracking condition factors provides insight into the quality distribution of future market supply.

**Size composition monitoring**: The **collapse in the proportion of medium to large mackerel (>300g) from 16.2% to 3.6%** demonstrates how rapidly size composition can shift. Regular monitoring of size composition in catches provides early indication of quality channel effects on prices.

The integration of biological indicators with environmental monitoring creates a **multi-stage forecasting system**:

#### Quality Channel Dominance in Price Forecasting

The research has demonstrated that **quality effects dominate quantity effects in price formation** under current market conditions. This finding has critical implications for price forecasting—predictions based solely on total catch volume will be unreliable when size composition shifts significantly.

The Korean market experience provides the clearest illustration: despite a **2.4-fold increase in total catch**, prices rose because the **proportion of medium to large mackerel collapsed from 16.2% to 3.6%**. Price forecasting systems must therefore prioritize quality indicators over quantity indicators.

Key quality channel indicators for price forecasting include:

| Quality Indicator | Data Source | Price Relationship | Forecasting Application |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Large fish proportion (>300g)** | Commercial sampling | Strong negative | Primary price predictor |
| **Mean weight-at-age** | Survey data | Negative | Quality trend indicator |
| **Condition factor** | Biological sampling | Negative | Quality adjustment factor |
| **Fat content (seasonal)** | Laboratory analysis | Premium pricing | Seasonal price premium |

The **positive allometric growth (b = 3.37)** documented in the length-weight relationship means that larger fish are disproportionately more valuable, amplifying the price impact of size composition changes. Forecasting models should incorporate this non-linear size-value relationship.

#### Practical Forecasting Framework Implementation

Based on the research findings, a practical market forecasting framework for chub mackerel would incorporate the following elements:

**Long-term outlook (2-4 years)**: Based on spawning-season environmental conditions relative to thresholds. Years with SST consistently below 18.3°C and/or chlorophyll-a below 0.46 mg/m³ during February-June should be flagged as likely to produce weak recruitment and subsequent supply constraints.

**Medium-term projection (1-2 years)**: Based on PDO phase and recruitment indices. The lagged correlation structure enables prediction of catch trends from current climate conditions, with recruitment survey data providing validation.

**Short-term forecast (0-12 months)**: Based on biological indicators including weight-at-age, condition factors, and size composition trends. The quality channel dominance means that size composition forecasts are more important than total volume forecasts for price prediction.

**Seasonal adjustment**: Based on the **nearly four-fold seasonal variation in crude lipid content** and associated quality premiums. Norwegian autumn mackerel commands premium prices due to higher fat content, creating predictable seasonal price patterns.

The forecasting framework should be calibrated to specific market contexts, recognizing that price formation mechanisms may differ across markets. The **Korean market's strong preference for larger fish** makes it particularly sensitive to size composition changes, while other markets may show different quality-price relationships.

### 7.3 Climate Adaptation Strategies for Shifting Stock Distribution and Productivity

The documented **northward distribution shift of 0.27° latitude per year** and projected spawning ground changes by the 2050s require proactive adaptation strategies from management authorities, fishing industries, and market participants. The research has established that climate change is fundamentally restructuring the spatial distribution of chub mackerel populations, with implications for national catch allocations, fishing fleet operations, and processing infrastructure. This section examines adaptation strategies addressing these transformative changes.

#### International Allocation Framework Implications

The projected redistribution of chub mackerel spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds has significant implications for the allocation of catches among Pacific Rim nations. The research projected that by the 2050s, **the main spawning ground will shift northward and cover a larger area compared to the 2010s**, with the **ratios of exploitable chub mackerel biomass and production increasing in the Korea Strait and Yellow Sea relative to the Japan/East Sea**[^8][^75].

This redistribution creates challenges for existing allocation frameworks. The NPFC Conservation and Management Measure currently specifies that **Members participating in fisheries in areas under national jurisdiction adjacent to the Convention Area may divert part of their national jurisdiction catch limit to their catch in the Convention Area**, with this provision applying specifically to Russia and Japan[^77]. As stock distribution shifts, the relative importance of different national jurisdictions will change, potentially requiring renegotiation of allocation arrangements.

The following table illustrates projected changes in regional biomass distribution:

| Region | 2010s Proportion | 2050s Projection | Change | Jurisdictional Implication |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **East China Sea** | 77.34% (May larvae) | 71.29% | -6.05% | Reduced Chinese/Japanese access |
| **Korea Strait/Yellow Sea** | 6.99% (May larvae) | 15.96% | +8.97% | Increased Korean/Chinese access |
| **Japan/East Sea** | Variable | Increasing | Northward shift | Changed Japanese access patterns |

The research concluded that **international collaborative research, including comprehensive ichthyoplankton surveys and data sharing, is recommended to enhance model performance** and track ongoing redistribution[^74]. This collaborative approach is essential for developing adaptive allocation frameworks that respond to changing stock distribution.

#### Adaptive Strategies for Fishing Fleets

Fishing fleets facing changing access patterns require adaptation strategies addressing operational, technological, and economic dimensions. The documented **eastward expansion of chub mackerel distribution, with age-0 and age-1 fish extending even east of 180°E**, means that traditional fishing grounds may become less productive while new areas become accessible.

**Operational adaptations** include:
- Extended voyage distances to access fish in new locations
- Modified seasonal timing to align with shifted migration patterns
- Diversification of target species to maintain vessel utilization

**Technological adaptations** include:
- Enhanced vessel monitoring systems to track fish distribution changes
- Improved fuel efficiency for extended operations
- Advanced fish-finding technology to locate dispersed stocks

**Economic adaptations** include:
- Fleet restructuring to match changed access patterns
- Investment in larger vessels capable of operating in more distant waters
- Cooperative arrangements among fishing nations to share access

The Chinese light purse seine fleet operating in the NPFC Convention Area provides an example of fleet adaptation. The fleet has **followed the northwestward movement of fishing ground gravity centers** over the 2016-2021 period, demonstrating operational flexibility in response to distribution changes. However, the **very broad distribution of age-0 and age-1 fish extending eastward** suggests that further adaptation will be required as distribution continues to shift.

Japan's proposal to revise the Conservation and Management Measure reflects adaptation to changed conditions. The proposal notes that **after high seas fishing began in 2016, the stock has been drastically dwindling**, and recommends setting **TAC in the Convention Area well below 50,000 metric tons** to ensure total annual catch stays below 150,000 metric tons[^76]. This represents adaptation through catch reduction to allow stock recovery.

#### Infrastructure Requirements for Evolving Catch Geography

The geographic shift in catch patterns creates requirements for adapted processing and trade infrastructure. As catches increasingly occur in northern areas, processing capacity may need to shift accordingly to minimize transportation costs and maintain product quality.

**Processing infrastructure considerations** include:
- Location of processing facilities relative to changing landing patterns
- Cold chain capacity in new landing areas
- Labor availability in northern regions

**Port infrastructure considerations** include:
- Berthing and unloading capacity in ports serving new fishing grounds
- Ice and fuel supply in northern locations
- Vessel maintenance and repair facilities

**Trade infrastructure considerations** include:
- Transportation networks connecting new production areas to markets
- Export certification capacity in new locations
- Market access arrangements for products from different origins

The research noted that **small mackerels that dominate recent catches are reportedly being exported rather than consumed domestically** in Korea, as they do not meet consumer preferences for larger fish. This illustrates how changed catch composition affects trade patterns and infrastructure requirements.

#### International Cooperative Research Recommendations

The research consistently emphasizes the need for **international collaborative research among regional countries** to track ongoing redistribution and enhance management capabilities[^74][^8]. Specific recommendations for cooperative research include:

**Comprehensive ichthyoplankton surveys**: Coordinated surveys across spawning and nursery grounds to track changes in egg and larval distribution. The research noted that **international collaborative research is recommended to enhance model performance, particularly through comprehensive ichthyoplankton surveys and fisheries data sharing**[^74].

**Data sharing protocols**: Standardized data collection and sharing arrangements among fishing nations to enable integrated stock assessments. The NPFC framework already requires members to **provide data on chub mackerel catches separated by the Convention Area and adjacent national jurisdiction areas**[^77], but enhanced biological and environmental data sharing would improve assessment capabilities.

**Joint research cruises**: Coordinated research vessel operations to survey stock distribution across national boundaries. China's **five-year scientific survey plan in the NPFC Convention Area using the fishery survey ship Songxing**[^80] provides a model for systematic research coverage.

**Climate projection collaboration**: Joint efforts to project future stock distribution under different climate scenarios, enabling anticipatory adaptation planning. The research using **Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to project conditions for the 2010s and 2050s**[^75] demonstrates the value of such projections for adaptation planning.

### 7.4 Building Economic Resilience in Dependent Markets and Supply Chains

The documented price volatility—with **Korean import prices doubling within one year** and **Japanese wholesale prices increasing 30% over five years**—underscores the need for strategies to build economic resilience among market participants facing supply volatility driven by environmental forcing. This section examines risk management approaches, diversification strategies, and policy interventions that can enhance market resilience.

#### Risk Management Strategies for Importers and Processors

Market participants facing supply volatility require risk management strategies that account for the environmental drivers of supply uncertainty. The research has established that **environmental monitoring provides leading indicators of supply conditions**, creating opportunities for anticipatory risk management.

**Inventory management strategies** should incorporate environmental forecasts. When spawning-season conditions indicate likely weak recruitment (SST below 18.3°C, chlorophyll-a below 0.46 mg/m³), importers and processors should anticipate supply constraints 2-4 years later and adjust inventory positions accordingly. Japan's cold storage data showing **frozen chub mackerel holdings of 74,444 MT as of April 2024** provides a baseline for assessing inventory adequacy.

**Contract structures** can be adapted to allocate climate-related supply risk. Long-term supply contracts might include provisions for quantity adjustments based on environmental conditions or stock assessment outcomes, enabling more equitable risk sharing between suppliers and buyers.

**Hedging strategies** may include:
- Forward contracting during periods of favorable environmental conditions
- Diversification across supply sources with different environmental exposures
- Financial instruments linked to climate indices or catch outcomes

The **canned mackerel industry's decline**—with production in Japan falling **50 percent over five years** and purchase prices doubling—illustrates the consequences of inadequate risk management in the face of supply constraints. Processors who failed to anticipate supply changes faced margin compression and production curtailment.

#### Diversification Approaches for Supply-Dependent Markets

Markets heavily dependent on chub mackerel face concentration risk that can be mitigated through diversification strategies. The research documented that **South Korea imports most of its mackerel from Norway**, creating exposure to Norwegian supply conditions and quota decisions. The **ICES recommendation to reduce North Atlantic mackerel quotas by 70% for 2025** (from 577,000 tonnes to 174,000 tonnes) directly affects Korean supply availability.

**Species diversification** involves developing alternative supply sources for substitute species. The research noted that **jack mackerel has been sought by brands as an alternative** to Atlantic mackerel, with **certified sustainable MSC labelled jack mackerel products available in some countries**[^81]. Similar substitution opportunities may exist for Pacific chub mackerel.

**Geographic diversification** involves sourcing from multiple fishing areas with different environmental exposures. The Ecuadorian small pelagic fishery, with **Pacific chub mackerel landings of 158,121 MT in 2022**[^17], represents a potential alternative supply source for Pacific Rim markets, though distance and product characteristics may limit substitutability.

**Product form diversification** involves developing markets for different product presentations that may be less sensitive to size composition changes. The shift toward **processed seafood products and home meal replacement (HMR) products** documented in Korean consumption patterns creates opportunities for product forms that can utilize smaller fish.

#### Policy Interventions to Moderate Consumer Price Impacts

Government policy interventions can moderate the consumer price impacts of supply volatility, though the effectiveness of such interventions is constrained by the fundamental supply-demand dynamics documented in the research.

**Tariff policy adjustments** represent the most direct intervention mechanism. South Korea's implementation of a **10,000-ton tariff quota reducing the tariff from 10% to 0%** demonstrates this approach[^77]. Government officials have indicated plans to **apply more tariff quotas for mackerel** in response to price pressures. However, the research noted that **zero tariffs cannot offset the doubling of underlying import prices**, and **exchange rate effects compound price pressures independently of tariff levels**.

**Strategic reserve management** could provide buffer stocks to moderate price volatility. However, the perishable nature of fresh mackerel limits the feasibility of strategic reserves, though frozen product reserves are more practical.

**Consumer information programs** can help consumers adjust to changed market conditions by providing guidance on alternative species and product forms. Japan's Fisheries Agency **designation of the 3rd to the 7th of each month as "Sakana no Hi" (Fish Day)** to promote fish consumption[^78] provides a model for consumer engagement.

**Support for affected industries** may be necessary when supply constraints cause economic hardship. The documented **decline in canned mackerel production** and associated employment impacts may warrant transitional support for affected workers and communities.

#### Quality Differentiation and Product Innovation

The dominance of quality effects in price formation creates opportunities for market participants to maintain viability through quality differentiation and product innovation strategies.

**Premium positioning** can capture value from high-quality segments even when overall supply is constrained. The **premium commanded by Norwegian autumn mackerel ("Saba Nouveau") due to fat content approximately twice that of local stocks** demonstrates successful quality differentiation. Producers and marketers can emphasize quality attributes to maintain margins despite volume constraints.

**Value-added processing** can create market value from smaller fish that do not meet consumer preferences for whole large fish. The research noted that **small mackerels that dominate recent catches are reportedly being exported** rather than consumed domestically in Korea. Developing processed products that utilize smaller fish could expand market opportunities.

**Sustainability certification** can differentiate products in markets where consumers value environmental responsibility. The **Seafood Watch "Good Alternative" rating for Pacific chub mackerel from Ecuador**[^17] and **Japanese fisheries**[^82] provides a framework for sustainability-based differentiation.

**New product development** can address changing consumer preferences. The **5,090 new food products containing fish and fish product ingredients launched in South Korea from 2019-2024**, with emphasis on **ease of use and microwaveable** characteristics, demonstrates the market opportunity for innovative product forms.

### 7.5 Policy Recommendations for Coupled Natural-Human System Governance

The research has established that chub mackerel operates as a **coupled natural-human system** where environmental variability propagates through biological intermediaries to produce economic consequences. Effective governance of such systems requires policy frameworks that recognize these linkages and respond adaptively to changing conditions. This section provides integrated policy recommendations addressing coordination across jurisdictions, alignment of management principles, investment priorities, and governance frameworks capable of responding to non-stationary climate-biology relationships.

#### Coordination of Management Measures Across Jurisdictions

The straddling nature of chub mackerel stocks—with **spawning grounds in Japanese coastal waters** but exploitation occurring across multiple national jurisdictions and the NPFC Convention Area—requires coordinated management measures to ensure conservation effectiveness.

**Current coordination mechanisms** include the NPFC Conservation and Management Measure, which requests that **Members participating in fisheries in areas under national jurisdiction adjacent to the Convention Area take compatible measures**[^77][^83]. However, the research documented that **catches in Coastal Member EEZs account for 70%-100% of the total catch**[^76], indicating that high seas measures alone cannot ensure stock sustainability.

**Enhanced coordination recommendations** include:

**Recommendation 1: Harmonized TAC systems**. National TAC systems should be aligned with NPFC measures to ensure that total removals across all jurisdictions remain within sustainable limits. Japan's domestic TAC system, which includes **chub mackerel among species subject to TAC management**[^84], provides a model for national implementation that could be coordinated with NPFC limits.

**Recommendation 2: Compatible harvest control rules**. Harvest control rules applied in national waters should be compatible with those applied in the Convention Area, ensuring consistent management across the stock's range. The research finding that **high fishing pressure hinders the recovery of chub mackerel stocks** supports the need for coordinated precautionary approaches.

**Recommendation 3: Coordinated closed seasons**. The timing of closed seasons should be coordinated across jurisdictions to maximize conservation benefits. Research on optimal harvest strategies found that **a closed season in July immediately after spawning provides the highest resource recovery efficiency**[^50][^85], suggesting a basis for coordinated seasonal closures.

**Recommendation 4: Joint monitoring and enforcement**. Coordinated monitoring and enforcement across jurisdictions can address IUU fishing concerns. The NPFC measure requiring that **Members cooperate to share information and eliminate IUU fishing for chub mackerel**[^77][^83] provides a foundation for enhanced cooperation.

#### Alignment with Climate-Responsive Management Principles

Management frameworks should be aligned with principles that recognize climate-driven environmental variability as a fundamental driver of stock dynamics. The research documented that **environmental forcing explains over 80% of catch variance**, indicating that management approaches treating environmental conditions as constant background will be inadequate.

**Climate-responsive management principles** include:

**Principle 1: Environmental integration**. Stock assessments and management decisions should systematically incorporate environmental information. The research recommendation that **managers focus on the impact of climate warming on marine ecosystem population composition**[^5] should be operationalized through formal assessment protocols.

**Principle 2: Adaptive management**. Management measures should be designed for adaptation as conditions change. The documented **non-stationary nature of climate-biology relationships** indicates that fixed management rules will become increasingly inappropriate over time.

**Principle 3: Precautionary approach**. Given uncertainty about climate impacts, management should apply precautionary buffers. The NPFC Convention **General Principles include paragraph (h) stipulating that any expansion of fishing effort does not proceed without prior assessment of impacts**[^83], supporting precautionary approaches.

**Principle 4: Ecosystem consideration**. Management should consider ecosystem-level effects of climate change, including interactions among species. The research documented **density-dependent effects involving competition between chub mackerel and Japanese sardine**, indicating the need for multi-species management perspectives.

The Ecuadorian management framework provides elements of climate-responsive management, with the **Fishery Management Plan including actions to achieve an ecosystem approach to management** and managers using **a conservative ecological harvest control rule consistent with Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force recommendations**[^17]. These approaches could inform NPFC measure development.

#### Investment Priorities for Monitoring Infrastructure and Collaborative Research

Effective climate-responsive management requires investment in monitoring infrastructure and collaborative research capabilities. The research identified specific investment priorities that would enhance management effectiveness.

**Environmental monitoring investments** should include:
- Expanded ocean observation networks covering spawning and nursery grounds
- Enhanced satellite monitoring capabilities for SST and chlorophyll-a
- Real-time data transmission and analysis systems
- Integration of environmental data into stock assessment workflows

**Biological monitoring investments** should include:
- Expanded survey coverage across the stock's range
- Enhanced biological sampling for age, growth, and condition parameters
- Genetic studies to understand population structure and connectivity
- Early life stage research to improve recruitment prediction

**Collaborative research investments** should include:
- Joint research cruises among regional countries
- Data sharing infrastructure enabling integrated analyses
- Capacity building for stock assessment in all fishing nations
- Climate projection studies specific to chub mackerel habitat

The research noted that **China has implemented a five-year scientific survey plan (2021-2025) in the NPFC Convention Area**[^80], while **Japan conducts summer and autumn mid-water trawl surveys and year-round egg surveys**[^80]. Coordination and expansion of these efforts would enhance regional assessment capabilities.

#### Governance Frameworks for Non-Stationary Systems

The documented **regime shifts and non-stationary climate-biology relationships** require governance frameworks capable of responding to fundamental changes in system behavior. Traditional management approaches assuming stationary relationships will become increasingly inadequate as climate change continues.

**Adaptive governance elements** should include:

**Regular framework review**: Management measures should be subject to regular review and revision based on updated scientific advice. The NPFC measure specifying that **the Commission shall review and revise this CMM based on advice from the Scientific Committee, but no later than at the 10th Commission meeting**[^77] provides a mechanism for regular review.

**Regime shift detection**: Monitoring systems should be designed to detect regime shifts that may alter management-relevant relationships. The research documented **threshold years in the 1990s and late 1970s** where climate-biology relationships changed character.

**Scenario planning**: Management frameworks should incorporate scenario planning for different climate futures, enabling anticipatory adaptation rather than reactive response.

**Stakeholder engagement**: Governance processes should engage stakeholders in adaptation planning. The Ecuadorian framework includes **"Platforms of Dialogue" increasing stakeholder participation in developing the National Action Plan**[^17], providing a model for inclusive governance.

#### Synthesis: Integrated Policy Framework

The policy recommendations can be synthesized into an integrated framework for governing chub mackerel as a coupled natural-human system:

```

The integrated framework recognizes that **sustainable resource management and market resilience are interconnected objectives** that require coordinated action across scientific, management, and governance domains. The research has demonstrated that environmental conditions ultimately determine both stock sustainability and market economics, making climate-responsive management essential for achieving both objectives.

The key insight from this research is that **chub mackerel price dynamics in Pacific Rim markets are fundamentally driven by oceanographic conditions** acting through biological intermediaries. This understanding transforms the management challenge from one of controlling fishing pressure alone to one of adapting human systems to environmental variability while maintaining fishing pressure within sustainable limits. The policy recommendations presented in this chapter provide a framework for achieving this transformation, ensuring the long-term sustainability of chub mackerel stocks and the economic resilience of dependent markets in an era of accelerating environmental change.
