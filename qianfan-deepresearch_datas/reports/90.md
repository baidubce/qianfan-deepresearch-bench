# Shared Responsibility on the Road: A Framework for Allocating Liability in Accidents Involving Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)
## 1 The Technical and Operational Landscape of Modern ADAS

This chapter establishes the foundational technical understanding of modern Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), which is critical for analyzing liability in the shared human-machine context. It systematically examines the core components, from sensor hardware to decision-making algorithms, and classifies ADAS within the industry-standard SAE J3016 taxonomy to clarify the sustained role of the human driver. A detailed analysis of key functions—Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)—synthesizes reference materials to define their intended operational design, performance capabilities, and, crucially, their documented limitations. This technical groundwork explicitly highlights the inherent requirement for driver supervision and engagement, setting the stage for evaluating the "machine" side of responsibility in subsequent legal and liability discussions.

### 1.1 Foundational Taxonomy and System Architecture

The technical and operational scope of ADAS is formally defined by the SAE J3016 taxonomy, which establishes six levels of driving automation from Level 0 (No Driving Automation) to Level 5 (Full Driving Automation)[^1][^2]. **ADAS features relevant to the current shared driving context are explicitly classified as Level 1 (Driver Assistance) or Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation).** At Level 1, the system performs *either* lateral (steering) *or* longitudinal (acceleration/braking) vehicle motion control on a sustained basis, while the driver performs the remainder of the Dynamic Driving Task (DDT)[^1][^2]. Level 2 systems perform *both* lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control, but the driver must complete the Object and Event Detection and Response (OEDR) subtask and supervise the system[^1][^2]. This taxonomy is pivotal because it clarifies that for Levels 0-2, the human driver is responsible for the complete DDT, even when assistance features are engaged[^2]. Active safety systems like automatic emergency braking, which provide only momentary intervention, are excluded from this level classification[^1][^2].

The hardware architecture enabling these functions consists of a sensor suite and a central processing unit. The sensor suite typically includes:
*   **Cameras:** Provide rich visual data for detecting lane markings, traffic signs, and classifying objects but struggle with distance estimation and degrade in poor lighting or adverse weather[^3][^4].
*   **Radar (mmWave):** Excels at measuring distance and relative velocity with minimal weather impact, crucial for functions like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Forward Collision Warning (FCW), but has lower resolution and difficulty with small or non-metallic objects[^3][^4].
*   **LiDAR:** Provides precise range and 3D shape data, works in low light, and aids in detecting small distant objects, but is more common in higher-end systems transitioning to higher automation levels[^3][^4].
*   **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Used for close-range detection, primarily supporting automated parking and low-speed collision prevention[^3][^4].

Data from these sensors is transmitted to the **ADAS Electronic Control Unit (ECU)** or domain controller[^5]. The ECU houses the processor that runs perception and decision-making algorithms. It also manages critical supporting functions, including power distribution via integrated Power Management ICs (PMICs) to avoid interference between controllers and circuit protection using components like TVS diodes to guard against transient overvoltage from events like electrostatic discharge[^5]. This architecture defines the system's technical boundaries and foundational failure mitigation strategies.

### 1.2 Perception and Decision-Making: Sensor Fusion and Algorithms

The raw data from individual sensors is transformed into a coherent understanding of the vehicle's environment through **sensor fusion**, a critical software layer[^4]. This process combines data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate, robust, and comprehensive environmental model than any single sensor could provide[^3]. The core value of fusion lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of different sensors; for example, fusing a camera's superior object classification with radar's precise distance and velocity measurement[^3].

The fusion process operates at multiple levels. **Low-level fusion** involves aligning data in time and space, associating radar tracks with visual detection boxes to form stable target trajectories[^4]. **High-level fusion** integrates semantic information (e.g., "pedestrian," "vehicle"), free space detection, and dynamic object predictions to output a unified environmental model for the vehicle's planning and control systems[^4]. A generalized algorithmic pipeline for this process involves four steps: **Detect** (sensors monitor the environment), **Segment** (data is grouped), **Classify** (objects are identified), and **Monitor** (objects are tracked in real-time)[^3].

To meet stringent functional safety requirements, ADAS perception systems are designed with **multi-source redundancy and health monitoring**. This includes cross-checking data between critical sensor channels, implementing sensor self-diagnosis, and defining degradation strategies to maintain a minimum level of safe operation if a sensor fails[^4]. However, these systems face significant challenges, including the substantial processing power required for real-time data interpretation and the need for standardization across platforms[^3]. **The inherent limitations of the sensors and the complexity of the fusion algorithms directly define the operational boundaries and potential failure modes of the ADAS, which are central to liability analysis.**

### 1.3 Functional Deep Dive: Capabilities and Documented Limitations

A detailed examination of specific ADAS functions reveals a consistent pattern: designed capabilities are coupled with explicit operational constraints. The following table synthesizes reference materials to summarize the key characteristics of three representative functions.

| ADAS Function | Core Capability & Design Intent | Key Operational Design Domain (ODD) Constraints & Documented Limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)** | Uses cameras, radar, or other sensors to identify potential collisions and automatically activate brakes to avoid or mitigate impact[^6]. Effective in reducing rear-end collisions at lower speeds[^7]. | **Speed Range:** Most are designed for 6-50 mph[^6]. **Scenario Limitations:** Primarily designed for rear-end collisions; **largely ineffective in intersection-based scenarios like T-bone crashes or when turning across traffic**[^6][^7]. **Recognition Variability:** Capability to recognize pedestrians, cyclists, or animals varies by system[^6]. **False Activations:** Possible due to sensor misinterpretations[^6]. |
| **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)** | A reactive system that detects unintentional lane departure (typically when turn signal is off) and provides steering input and/or braking to guide the vehicle back toward lane center[^8][^9]. | **Operational Dependency:** Heavily reliant on clear, visible lane markings; performance degrades with faded, obscured (snow, dirt), or missing markings, and on hills or sharp curves[^8]. **Speed Threshold:** Typically activates only at highway speeds (e.g., ~40 mph or above)[^8][^9]. **Driver Interaction:** Requires constant supervision; can be easily overridden by driver steering input[^8]. Studies note issues with false positives and high driver deactivation rates[^8]. |
| **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)** | An extension of cruise control that uses sensor fusion (typically radar and camera) to maintain a set speed while automatically adjusting speed to maintain a safe following distance from a vehicle ahead[^4][^10]. | **Sensor-Dependent:** Performance is tied to the capabilities and limitations of its underlying radar and camera sensors (e.g., radar may struggle with static objects)[^4][^10]. **System Architecture:** Represents a complex integration of sensors, ECU processing, and communication with other vehicle ECUs (powertrain, braking)[^10]. **Driver Responsibility:** The driver remains responsible for overall monitoring and must be ready to intervene, especially outside the system's ODD[^10]. |

**The analysis clearly demonstrates that no contemporary ADAS feature is designed for unconditional, full autonomy.** Each function operates within a limited Operational Design Domain (ODD) defined by factors such as speed, road type, environmental conditions, and scenario type[^2]. Performance degradation or failure outside these domains is not an anomaly but a documented characteristic. **Consequently, the legal principle of sustained driver responsibility, as codified in the SAE Levels 0-2 taxonomy, is underpinned by these concrete technical limitations.** The driver's duty to supervise is a direct response to the system's inability to handle the full DDT or all possible driving scenarios. This creates the fundamental "shared control" paradigm where responsibility is diffuse and context-dependent, setting the stage for the complex liability challenges explored in subsequent chapters.

## 2 Legal Frameworks and Evolving Jurisprudence for Automated Vehicle Liability

This chapter analyzes the current and evolving legal frameworks governing liability for accidents involving vehicles with automated features, directly building upon the technical understanding of ADAS limitations established in Chapter 1. The shared control paradigm, where the human driver and the ADAS jointly manage the driving task, creates profound legal challenges. This analysis compares how different jurisdictions define and regulate vehicles based on automation levels, examines the strained application of traditional tort principles, identifies core legal hurdles in shared control scenarios, and evaluates emerging liability models designed to address these complexities. The goal is to map the legal terrain where technology has outpaced traditional doctrine, revealing both the current patchwork of approaches and the potential pathways toward a more coherent and equitable liability framework.

### 2.1 Jurisdictional Definitions and the Legal Distinction Between Automation Levels

The legal treatment of an accident involving automated features depends first on how the vehicle and its systems are categorized by law. Jurisdictions worldwide are grappling with creating statutory definitions that distinguish between driver-assistance systems (SAE Levels 0-2) and autonomous vehicles (SAE Levels 3-5), a distinction that fundamentally dictates the primary locus of legal responsibility.

**A comparative analysis reveals a spectrum of approaches, often aligned with SAE levels but with significant local variations.** In the **United States**, there is no unified federal definition, leading to a state-by-state patchwork. For instance, Tennessee’s legislation reflects a **manufacturer and operator liability regime** for higher automation levels[^11]. California’s legal environment, as seen in *Ortiz v. Daimler Trucks N. Am.*, currently handles ADAS-equipped vehicles (Level 2 or below) through the extension of traditional product liability and negligence principles, without a specific autonomous vehicle statute altering the driver’s foundational duty[^12].

The **European Union**’s revised Product Liability Directive (PLD) takes a technology-agnostic but expansive approach, defining “product” to explicitly include “software” and “AI systems,” thereby encompassing ADAS and more advanced systems under a modernized strict liability framework[^13][^14]. This does not erase the driver’s role but strengthens claims against manufacturers for software-related defects. **Germany** and **France** have enacted laws that formalize a shift in liability at higher automation levels. Germany’s Road Traffic Act stipulates that liability transfers to the vehicle manufacturer if an accident occurs during *system operation*, while the driver retains liability under manual control[^11]. France’s Highway Code absolves the driver of liability when the vehicle functions in an approved automated-driving mode, placing responsibility on the manufacturer or system operator[^11].

In Asia, **Japan**’s revised Road Traffic Act creates a framework for Level 3+ operations, requiring service providers or operators to monitor vehicles and assume legal responsibility for safety and accidents[^11][^15]. Similarly, **South Korea**’s Autonomous Vehicles Act stipulates that within designated Level 4 zones, the operator or owner is liable for any harm incurred[^11]. **China** presents a case of national legislative lag compensated by local experimentation. Regulations in cities like Shenzhen stipulate that for vehicles below Level 2, the driver bears primary responsibility, while for Level 4 and above, the vehicle owner or manager assumes liability, with recourse against manufacturers under product liability laws[^11]. Scholarly consensus proposes a tiered model for China: driver liability (L0-L2), shared liability (L3), and manufacturer/operator liability (L4-L5)[^11].

**The United Kingdom** has pioneered a distinct **system liability regime** through its Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 and the Automated Vehicles Act 2024. This model establishes a no-fault insurance framework where the insurer is primarily liable for accidents caused by a vehicle “driving itself,” subsequently recovering costs from at-fault parties. The 2024 Act further creates an **Authorised Self-Driving Entity (ASDE)** as the legally responsible entity for the automated system’s performance[^11][^16]. **Australia**, with its proposed Automated Vehicle Safety Law, is considering a similar **Authorised Driving Entity (ADSE)** model[^11][^17].

The table below synthesizes these jurisdictional approaches, highlighting the correlation between automation level and the primary liable party.

| Jurisdiction | Primary Legal Framework for ADAS (L0-L2) | Evolving Framework for Higher Automation (L3+) | Core Liability Model for L3+ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **United States (e.g., CA)** | Traditional Negligence & Product Liability[^12][^18] | State-specific laws (e.g., TN)[^11]; No federal statute. | Patchwork; leaning toward Manufacturer/Operator or Composite regimes[^11]. |
| **European Union** | Negligence & Product Liability (modernized by PLD)[^13][^14] | Product Liability Directive (PLD) explicitly covers software/AI[^13]. | **Strict Product Liability** (enhanced, claimant-friendly). |
| **Germany** | Driver liability under Road Traffic Act[^11] | Liability transfers to manufacturer during system operation[^11]. | **Manufacturer Liability** regime. |
| **United Kingdom** | Driver negligence[^16] | Automated Vehicles Act; insurer/ASDE primary liability[^11][^16]. | **System Liability** regime (ASDE/Insurer). |
| **Japan** | Driver liability; Vehicle Operation Liability Law[^15] | Revised Road Traffic Act places responsibility on authorized operators[^11][^15]. | **Manufacturer/Operator Liability** regime. |
| **South Korea** | Driver liability[^11] | Autonomous Vehicles Act imposes liability on operator/owner in L4 zones[^11]. | **Manufacturer/Operator Liability** regime. |
| **China (Local)** | Driver-centric liability in local regulations (e.g., Shenzhen)[^11] | Proposed tiered model: shared (L3) to manufacturer (L4-L5) liability[^11]. | **Composite/Transitional** regime (proposed). |

**The clear global pattern is a transition from driver-centric liability at lower automation levels to manufacturer, operator, or system-centric liability at higher levels.** This legal re-alignment reflects the technical reality that as the system assumes more of the Dynamic Driving Task, the party with technical control and oversight capacity should bear corresponding responsibility. For the current ADAS landscape (L0-L2), however, the law largely maintains the principle of sustained driver responsibility, even as it adapts tort doctrines to hold manufacturers accountable for system failures.

### 2.2 Application of Traditional Tort Principles: Negligence and Product Liability

When accidents involve ADAS, plaintiffs and courts must navigate traditional tort doctrines that were not designed for shared human-machine control. The application of negligence and product liability principles is being tested and stretched, revealing both their enduring relevance and their significant limitations.

**Negligence claims** require proving duty, breach, causation, and damages. For drivers, the duty of care remains paramount: they must operate the vehicle with reasonable caution, which includes **not over-relying on ADAS and maintaining proper supervision**[^19][^20]. A breach occurs if a driver, for example, ignores lane departure warnings or engages in distracted driving despite system engagement[^19][^21]. For manufacturers, the duty extends to designing systems with reasonable care to avoid unreasonable risks. The landmark case ***Ortiz v. Daimler Trucks N. Am.*** is instructive. The California Court of Appeal held that a manufacturer could owe a duty of care in the design of its vehicle, including the **decision not to install an optional advanced safety system** (Detroit Assurance 4.0)[^12]. The court rejected the argument that the accident was too remote, finding it reasonably foreseeable that some drivers would fail to brake and that the optional system was designed precisely to prevent such collisions[^12]. This ruling signifies that **a manufacturer’s duty may encompass judgments about offering safety features as optional rather than standard, at least for a jury to consider**.

**Product liability** is a critical and often parallel avenue for claims against manufacturers. Three primary theories apply to ADAS[^19][^22]:
1.  **Design Defect**: The overall design is inherently unsafe. This could involve inadequate sensor fusion algorithms, poor human-machine interface (HMI) design that fails to keep the driver adequately engaged, or the deliberate exclusion of a safety feature that could have prevented harm, as argued in *Ortiz*[^12][^23].
2.  **Manufacturing Defect**: The product deviates from its intended design. Examples include a faulty sensor, software coding errors, or improper calibration during assembly[^19][^22][^23].
3.  **Failure to Warn**: Providing improper instructions or failing to warn consumers of latent defects or system limitations. This is crucial for ADAS, where drivers may not understand the Operational Design Domain (ODD) boundaries[^19][^22].

**Proving these defects, especially causation, is a formidable challenge.** Plaintiffs must show the defect was the “actual and proximate cause” of the harm[^18]. In complex ADAS cases, disentangling whether an accident was caused by a system malfunction, driver error, or a combination is difficult. The **“malfunction doctrine”** (not recognized in all states) can help by allowing an inference of defect from the product’s failure, but it does not eliminate the causation hurdle[^23]. Furthermore, as noted in legal analysis, even if a defect exists, a manufacturer may argue it was merely an “instrument” in the accident and not the legal cause, especially if a negligent driver was the primary actor[^18].

**The new EU Product Liability Directive (PLD) represents a significant evolution aimed at lowering these barriers.** Key innovations relevant to ADAS include:
*   **Explicit Inclusion of Software**: Software, firmware, AI systems, and over-the-air (OTA) updates are defined as “products,” making them subject to strict liability[^13][^14].
*   **Cybersecurity as a Defect**: A failure to provide necessary security updates, leading to a vulnerability being exploited, can constitute a defect[^13].
*   **Rebuttable Presumptions**: The PLD introduces presumptions to ease the claimant’s burden. Defectiveness can be presumed if the manufacturer fails to disclose evidence, if the product violates mandatory safety rules, or if there is an “obvious malfunction.” Causation can be presumed if the damage is of a type typically consistent with the defect[^13][^14]. Most importantly, **both defect and causation can be presumed when the claimant faces “excessive difficulties” due to technical or scientific complexity**—a scenario tailor-made for ADAS and autonomous vehicle litigation[^13][^14].
*   **Liability for Modifications**: Entities that substantially modify a product post-market, including via software updates outside the manufacturer’s control, can be deemed manufacturers[^13].

**These developments highlight a global trend toward strengthening manufacturer liability for software-driven systems, acknowledging the information asymmetry and complexity that disadvantage consumers.** However, they do not absolve the driver of their duties, setting the stage for the central conflict of apportioning fault in a shared control environment.

### 2.3 Key Legal Challenges: Duty, Causation, and Comparative Fault in Shared Control

The intersection of human and machine agency creates unique legal ambiguities that traditional tort law struggles to resolve. Three interrelated challenges stand out: defining dual duties, establishing causation, and applying comparative fault in a context of shared responsibility.

**The first challenge is the coexistence of potentially conflicting duties.** The **driver’s duty** is to supervise the ADAS and be prepared to intervene immediately[^19][^20]. This duty persists even as marketing and system behavior may encourage **“automation complacency,”** where drivers become over-reliant and reduce situational awareness[^19][^23]. The **manufacturer’s duty** encompasses designing a safe system, providing adequate warnings about its limits, and, as per *Ortiz*, potentially considering the safety implications of making critical features optional[^12]. A core tension arises from **“autonowashing”**—exaggerating system capabilities in marketing—which can erode the driver’s sense of responsibility and later be used by manufacturers to shift blame entirely onto the inattentive driver[^23]. This creates a “double bind” for drivers, who are encouraged to trust the technology but held fully responsible when that trust is misplaced[^23].

**The second and perhaps most formidable challenge is causation.** Legal causation requires proving that the defendant’s breach (e.g., a design defect or driver negligence) was both the actual cause (“but-for” cause) and the proximate cause (a legally recognized cause) of the harm[^18][^21]. In an ADAS accident, multiple potential causes intertwine: a possible sensor failure, an algorithmic misjudgment, the driver’s failure to monitor or override, and the actions of other road users. **Isolating the machine’s contribution is exceptionally difficult due to the “black box” nature of AI systems and the “many hands problem,” where responsibility is distributed across developers, engineers, and corporate entities**[^24][^25]. For instance, a plaintiff may allege the AEB system failed to activate, but the manufacturer may counter that the driver was tailgating or distracted, breaking the causal chain. Proving what a “properly functioning” ADAS would have done in the exact same millisecond-by-millisecond scenario is a high technical and evidentiary bar.

**The third challenge is the application of comparative fault doctrines.** Most jurisdictions have moved from contributory negligence (which bars recovery if the plaintiff is even 1% at fault, as in Washington, D.C.[^20]) to comparative negligence, which apportions liability and damages based on percentage of fault[^21]. In ADAS cases, this means a jury must decide, for example, that the manufacturer’s defective design was 70% responsible and the driver’s over-reliance was 30% responsible[^18][^23]. **This apportionment process is inherently complex and subjective,** requiring the fact-finder to weigh the culpability of human error against machine error—a task for which there is little legal precedent[^23][^16]. Furthermore, as seen in Japanese law, a driver’s or owner’s liability to a victim under one statute does not preclude them from seeking indemnity from a manufacturer under product liability law, with potential reductions for their own comparative fault[^15]. **These interactions can create liability gaps or overlaps, leading to prolonged litigation and uncertain outcomes for victims.**

### 2.4 Emerging Liability Models and Future Regulatory Directions

Recognizing the inadequacies of traditional frameworks, jurisdictions and legal scholars are proposing and enacting innovative liability models. These models aim to provide clearer rules, fairer compensation for victims, and a stable legal environment for innovation.

A comparative analysis reveals four dominant emerging liability regimes, each with different implications for the ADAS transition period[^11]:
1.  **Driver Liability Regime**: Applicable to SAE Levels 0-2, where the human driver is the primary operator and bears fault-based liability. This remains the default in most jurisdictions for current ADAS[^11].
2.  **Manufacturer/Operator Liability Regime**: Applicable to Level 3 and above, where liability shifts to the entity with technical control. Examples include Germany, France, Japan, and South Korea, where manufacturers or authorized operators become primarily liable when the automated system is engaged[^11].
3.  **System Liability Regime**: Creates a new legal entity (e.g., the UK’s Authorised Self-Driving Entity - ASDE) responsible for the system’s safe operation. This is often coupled with a no-fault insurance scheme where the insurer compensates victims first and then seeks recovery from the ASDE or other responsible parties[^11][^16].
4.  **Composite Liability Regime**: Designed for the transitional phase (particularly Level 3) where control is dynamically shared. It employs flexible, multi-factor tests to apportion fault among the driver, manufacturer, and operator based on the specific circumstances of control and failure[^11]. The United States and Canada currently reflect aspects of this approach through the application of traditional tort law and comparative fault[^11][^16].

**For the present era of Level 2 ADAS, the most relevant proposals focus on adapting existing law to the reality of collaborative driving.** Scholars argue that courts should **evaluate the human-machine system as a single, collaborative unit** when allocating liability, taking into account foreseeable human reactions like over-reliance that the system design should have mitigated[^23]. Furthermore, the legal system should recognize and incentivize **regular software updates** as part of the manufacturer’s ongoing duty of care, impacting both safety and jurisdictional questions[^23]. Another strategy is to encourage **fraud and warranty claims** for economic damages when manufacturers overstate capabilities (“autonowashing”), as these claims can force manufacturers to internalize the cost of defects before serious physical injuries occur[^23].

Looking forward, several regulatory directions are critical:
*   **Clarifying Data Access and Disclosure**: As seen in the EU PLD, empowering courts to order disclosure of technical data from manufacturers is essential to overcome information asymmetry[^13][^14]. Standards for Event Data Recorders (EDRs) that capture ADAS status and driver inputs are needed globally[^19][^22].
*   **Developing Tiered, Level-Specific Rules**: The proposal for China—and the logic evident in Germany and the UK—suggests that optimal regulation is vertically layered by SAE level[^11]. Clear legal triggers for liability transfer at Level 3 are necessary.
*   **Mandating Specialized Insurance Models**: The UK’s insurer-first model and the predicted shift from personal auto insurance to commercial/product liability lines (as forecast by KPMG) highlight the need for new insurance frameworks[^26][^16].
*   **Exploring New Tort Concepts**: Proposals like **“AI-Chaperone Liability”** suggest a strict liability rule for entities that deploy AI systems for traditionally human tasks, focusing on their supervisory control rather than proving specific fault or causation[^24]. This could address the “liability gap” in complex accidents.

**In conclusion, the legal framework for ADAS liability is in a state of disruptive transition.** While traditional negligence and product liability doctrines remain the primary tools, they are being strained and reinterpreted. The global trend is toward greater manufacturer responsibility for software and system performance, facilitated by modernized laws like the EU PLD. The ultimate goal for regulators is to develop a **multi-level, interoperable liability system** that provides clear ex-ante rules, ensures just compensation for victims, and maintains appropriate incentives for safety among all parties in the human-machine collaborative endeavor[^11].

## 3 Deconstructing the Shared Control Paradigm: A Systematic Analysis of Responsibility Boundaries

This chapter conducts a systematic, data-driven deconstruction of the shared control paradigm between human drivers and ADAS, building directly upon the technical foundations of Chapter 1 and the legal frameworks of Chapter 2. It focuses on identifying and analyzing the precise junctures and factors that determine where responsibility shifts or becomes ambiguous in accident scenarios. The analysis is structured around three core dimensions: the operational boundaries defined by the system's design (including ODD limitations and handover protocols), the human factors influencing driver performance (including monitoring duties and automation complacency), and the complex interaction of technical failures and edge cases. By synthesizing reference materials on documented system limitations, ODD management failures, liability case studies, and proposed statutory frameworks, this chapter will establish a multi-factor analytical model for apportioning responsibility. It serves as the critical bridge between technical capabilities and legal doctrines, directly addressing the core research question of liability allocation in the shared human-machine context.

### 3.1 Defining the Operational and Behavioral Boundaries of Shared Control

The shared control paradigm is not a free-form collaboration but operates within a defined technical and behavioral framework. The first step in deconstructing responsibility is to establish these boundaries, which delineate the expected performance envelope of the machine and the corresponding duties of the human.

**The foundational boundary is set by the SAE J3016 taxonomy, which unequivocally classifies contemporary ADAS features (e.g., AEB, LKA, ACC) as Level 1 (Driver Assistance) or Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation).** At these levels, the system is designed to **"assist rather than replace"** the human driver, who remains responsible for the complete Dynamic Driving Task (DDT), including monitoring the environment and being ready to take over immediately[^4]. This legal principle of sustained driver responsibility is not arbitrary but is directly underpinned by the system's technical limitations.

These limitations are formally captured by the concept of the **Operational Design Domain (ODD)**. The ODD defines the specific conditions under which a given driving automation system is designed to function safely[^27]. A standardized taxonomy, such as PAS 1883:2020, classifies ODD attributes into three top-level categories[^27]:
*   **Scenery**: Fixed elements like road type, junctions, and infrastructure.
*   **Environmental Conditions**: Dynamic factors such as weather (rain, snow, fog), illumination (day/night), and connectivity.
*   **Dynamic Elements**: Movable objects including traffic density, agent types (vehicles, vulnerable road users), and the subject vehicle's own state.

The system's performance, particularly its perception and decision-making algorithms, is validated only within this defined ODD. **Consequently, operation outside the ODD represents a fundamental boundary violation where system reliability is not guaranteed.** A critical analysis of accidents involving driving automation systems in the U.S. (2016-2019) found that **in 8 out of 9 cases studied, the accident occurred outside the system's defined ODD**[^28]. This stark finding underscores that ODD adherence is the primary technical precondition for assigning expected performance to the ADAS.

For SAE Level 1 and 2 systems, the responsibility for ensuring operation within the ODD—known as **ODD Management**—falls to the human driver[^28]. This duty involves continuously observing available information and assessing whether conditions remain within the system's operational limits. However, human ODD management is prone to systematic failures, which analysis categorizes into three modes[^28]:
1.  **Perception Failure**: The ODD-violating condition was not observable or noticed by the driver (e.g., faded lane markings in low light).
2.  **Understanding Failure**: The driver observed the condition but did not understand it required disengagement or intervention (e.g., not recognizing that heavy rain degrades sensor performance).
3.  **Prediction Failure**: The driver failed to anticipate that upcoming conditions would exit the ODD (e.g., not foreseeing that the highway curve ahead would be too sharp for the Lane Keeping Assist).

These failure modes are often fueled by a lack of accurate mental models of the system's capabilities and limitations, as well as **over-trust in automation**[^28]. Therefore, the behavioral boundary for the driver is not merely passive presence but **active, informed supervision** to perform effective ODD management. When an accident occurs, the initial analytical questions must be: Was the scenario within the system's ODD? If not, was the ODD exit foreseeable, and did the driver fulfill their management duty? The answers establish the first critical axis for apportioning responsibility between human error and a demand that exceeded the machine's design specifications.

### 3.2 Critical Junctures and Ambiguities in Responsibility Transfer

Within the shared control framework, responsibility is not static but dynamic, shifting at specific junctures. These transitions are where liability becomes most contested, often due to mismatches between technical design, human capabilities, and legal assumptions.

**The most scrutinized juncture is the takeover request (TOR) in conditional automation (Level 3) or the disengagement of an assist feature.** Human factors research indicates that **driver situation awareness degrades during automated driving**, and restoring it to safely resume control takes time[^29]. Acknowledging this, proposed statutory frameworks advocate for a **minimum "safe harbor" period (e.g., ten seconds) following an intervention request or a driver monitoring alert**[^30]. During this window, the human driver could not be found contributorily negligent as a matter of law, recognizing the reality of human reaction time and automation complacency. This concept highlights a core ambiguity: a system may technically provide a legally sufficient warning, but if the allotted time is physiologically insufficient for a complacent driver to perceive, comprehend, and act, the fairness of assigning full responsibility is questionable.

**This ambiguity is crystallized in joint-failure scenarios**, where both system and human performance are suboptimal. The 2018 Uber automated vehicle crash provides a canonical case study: the automated driving system inaccurately identified a pedestrian and delayed braking, while the human safety operator was distracted and failed to intervene[^31]. In such cases, the question is not *who* failed, but how to allocate responsibility for the *combined* failure. Research on human judgment in these scenarios shows that when a human and machine in a Level 3 vehicle jointly cause a crash, the public expects responsibility to be **shared between the driver and the manufacturer**[^31]. This public intuition challenges the binary "driver OR manufacturer" fault model often presented in litigation.

**A profound ambiguity arises from the conflict between marketing and operational reality, known as "autonowashing."** Manufacturers may market systems with names like "Autopilot" or "Full Self-Driving Capability," which can shape consumer expectations and behavior, encouraging over-reliance[^32][^33]. However, in court and user manuals, these same companies emphasize that the technology is an assist feature and the driver must maintain constant supervision[^33][^34]. This creates a **normative double bind for the driver**: they are commercially encouraged to trust the system's capabilities but legally penalized for doing so if that trust leads to reduced vigilance. A pivotal 2025 federal jury verdict against Tesla found the company partly liable for a fatal crash, concluding it **failed to adequately warn consumers about Autopilot's limitations**[^33]. This verdict underscores that marketing claims are increasingly seen as integral to defining the standard of care and the reasonableness of a driver's reliance.

Furthermore, responsibility transfer is muddied by **technical failures within the ODD**. Even when conditions are nominal, systems can suffer from "phantom braking" (unintended emergency braking)[^32], sensor misalignment post-repair[^19], or software errors. Here, the boundary issue is whether the failure constitutes a **product defect** (e.g., design flaw under ISO 26262 or an unexpected behavior under SOTIF/ISO 21448)[^35], or if it was a performance limitation inherent to the state-of-the-art technology. The latter scenario can create a "liability gap," where harm occurs but no party is legally at fault because the product was not defective by contemporary standards[^34].

### 3.3 A Multi-Factor Analytical Model for Apportioning Responsibility

To navigate the complexities outlined above, a structured, multi-factor model is necessary to apportion responsibility in ADAS-involved accidents. This model moves beyond isolating individual faults and instead evaluates the **human-machine system as a collaborative unit**[^34]. The performance of this combined system, rather than the actions of either agent in isolation, determines the outcome. The following table synthesizes key factors from the reference materials into an analytical framework.

| Analytical Dimension | Key Factors to Evaluate | Source of Evidence / Reference |

| **System State & ODD Compliance** | • Was the specific scenario within the defined Operational Design Domain (ODD)? <br> • Was the feature active and functioning as designed? <br> • Did the system provide timely and clear alerts for ODD exit or required intervention? | ODD definition documents, Event Data Recorder (EDR) logs, sensor data[^28][^27][^36]. |
| **Technical Performance & Failures** | • Was there a sensor malfunction, degradation, or misalignment? <br> • Was there an algorithmic error or software defect? <br> • Does the failure relate to a known issue (recall, complaint)? <br> • Was the behavior foreseeable and addressed by safety standards (ISO 26262, SOTIF)? | EDR data, technical service bulletins, recall notices, expert analysis of code/logs[^19][^35][^37]. |

**Applying the model requires a synthesized judgment.** For instance, an accident occurring **outside the ODD** due to a driver's **understanding failure** (e.g., using highway assist on a complex urban street) would weigh heavily toward driver responsibility. Conversely, a **"phantom braking" incident within the ODD** on a clear highway would shift focus to a potential **technical/design defect**, scrutinizing the sensor fusion algorithms and adherence to SOTIF principles[^35]. A rear-end collision where the AEB issued a warning but the driver, possibly complacent, failed to brake, presents a **shared liability** scenario. The model would assess the warning's clarity and timing, the driver's pre-impact attentiveness (from DMS), and whether the system's design adequately accounted for predictable human complacency[^36][^34].

This collaborative system model aligns with emerging legal thinking. It resonates with the proposed **"Computer Driver" negligence standard**, where the machine's performance is compared to that of a reasonable human driver[^30][^39]. The model's factors help operationalize that comparison. It also supports arguments against letting manufacturers use the "driver in the loop" as a blanket liability shield, emphasizing that the **design of the collaborative system must be safe as a whole**, accounting for foreseeable human misuse[^34].

**Ultimately, this multi-factor model provides a structured way to decompose the chaotic reality of an ADAS-related accident.** It acknowledges that responsibility is often distributed along a spectrum, influenced by the clarity of operational boundaries, the presence of technical flaws, the fulfillment of human duties, and the transparency of information provided. This analytical approach is essential for courts, insurers, and regulators to move beyond simplistic blame assignment and towards a more nuanced and equitable allocation of responsibility in the era of shared control.

## 4 Towards Equitable Allocation: Proposing Regulatory Guidelines and Recommendations

This chapter synthesizes the technical and legal analyses from previous chapters to propose concrete regulatory guidelines and actionable recommendations for achieving clearer and more equitable liability allocation in the ADAS era. It focuses on designing a graduated liability framework aligned with SAE automation levels and specific ADAS functionalities, addressing the core challenge of shared human-machine control. The analysis leverages reference materials to substantiate the need for and design of key regulatory pillars: mandatory data recording standards, enhanced consumer transparency regarding system capabilities and limitations, and robust certification/validation processes for ADAS. The chapter also explores the role of emerging regulatory initiatives like NHTSA's AV STEP program and the EU's Product Liability Directive in shaping these guidelines. The overarching goal is to propose a balanced regulatory approach that fosters innovation, ensures safety, protects consumers, and provides legal certainty for all stakeholders—manufacturers, insurers, and drivers—operating within the shared control paradigm.

### 4.1 Designing a Graduated Liability Framework Aligned with SAE Levels and System Functionality

A coherent and predictable liability regime must be explicitly structured around the technical capabilities defined by the SAE J3016 taxonomy[^2]. The core principle is that **legal responsibility should transition in step with the transfer of the Dynamic Driving Task (DDT) from the human to the system**. This necessitates moving beyond a binary "driver or manufacturer" fault model to a graduated framework that accounts for the nuanced sharing of control, particularly at the critical juncture of SAE Level 3.

**The proposed framework is anchored in the legal fiction of a "Computer Driver,"** a system collectively capable of steering a vehicle on a sustained basis without continual human input[^30][^40]. Under this model, the Computer Driver can be assigned negligence liability if its behavior fails to imitate or exceed the level of care expected of an attentive and unimpaired Human Driver, with the Manufacturer bearing financial responsibility[^30]. This concept provides a clear legal entity to which fault can be attributed when the system is in control, bridging the gap between engineering and jurisprudence.

The framework operationalizes this through distinct liability rules for four defined Operating Modes, which correlate with SAE levels[^30][^40]:

| Operating Mode (Correlated SAE Level) | Primary Locus of Liability & Key Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Conventional Mode (L0, L1 features without sustained steering)** | **Human Driver** under existing negligence law. The Computer Driver/Manufacturer may only be liable if it unexpectedly assumes control and causes an accident[^30][^40]. |
| **Supervisory Mode (L2, L3)** | **Shared/Transitional Liability**. This is the most complex mode, applicable when a Human Driver is expected to supervise the Computer Driver. **Liability transfers from the Computer Driver to the Human Driver only after specific conditions are met,** such as a minimum grace period (e.g., 10 seconds) following a clear driver monitoring alert or intervention request[^30]. This "safe harbor" period is critical to account for human reaction time and automation complacency[^30]. |
| **Autonomous Mode (L4, L5 within ODD)** | **Manufacturer of the Computer Driver**. The Manufacturer is liable for losses caused by a Negligent Computer Driver. The human occupant has no duty to supervise, and failure to intervene does not constitute contributory negligence[^30][^40]. |
| **Testing Mode (Pre-deployment)** | **Strict Manufacturer Liability**. For non-series-production vehicles or those in beta testing, the Manufacturer has strict liability for any accident, with very limited exceptions, to incentivize supreme caution during public road testing[^30]. |

**For contemporary ADAS (SAE Levels 1-2), this framework demands greater nuance than a blanket "driver responsibility" rule.** While the Human Driver remains ultimately responsible for the DDT, liability rules should consider the specific automated function and the manufacturer's duties. For instance, a system performing sustained automated steering (a key criterion for the "Computer Driver"[^30]) creates a different reliance dynamic and potential for complacency than a momentary automatic emergency braking intervention. The framework acknowledges that **even in Supervisory Mode, the Manufacturer retains liability for system defects and for failures in the design of the human-machine interface (e.g., unclear alerts) that contribute to an accident.** This approach aligns with and refines jurisdictional models like Germany's liability shift for system operation and the UK's Authorised Self-Driving Entity (ASDE) concept, providing the legal certainty needed by manufacturers, insurers, and courts.

### 4.2 Establishing Foundational Regulatory Pillars: Data, Transparency, and Validation

The graduated liability framework cannot function effectively without robust foundational pillars that enable accurate fault determination and set clear performance expectations. Three interconnected regulatory pillars are essential: standardized data recording, enforced consumer transparency, and rigorous system validation.

**1. Mandatory and Standardized Data Recording (The "Digital Witness")**
Objective crash reconstruction is impossible without reliable data. Regulations must mandate Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in all ADAS-equipped vehicles, with specifications that capture the shared control context. NHTSA's 2025 final rule, which extends the recording period for timed data to **20 seconds of pre-crash data at a frequency of 10 Hz**, is a critical step forward[^41]. This enhanced data is vital for determining:
*   **System Engagement:** Whether the ADS or ADAS was active within 30 seconds of the crash, as required by NHTSA's Standing General Order for crash reporting[^42].
*   **Driver Inputs:** Precise timing of brake, accelerator, and steering inputs to assess driver reaction and potential overrides.
*   **Vehicle Dynamics:** Speed and stability control activity to understand the pre-crash maneuver sequence.

Furthermore, reporting protocols like the EU Product Liability Directive's provision for courts to order disclosure of relevant evidence are necessary to overcome information asymmetry[^13]. **Standardized EDR data, accessible for investigation, is the bedrock for applying the graduated liability framework and resolving the causation challenges inherent in shared control scenarios.**

**2. Enforced Consumer Transparency and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Standards**
To fairly assign responsibility to drivers for supervision, they must first accurately understand the system's capabilities and limitations. Current practices, often described as "autonowashing," create a liability-distorting double bind. Regulations must enforce transparency, informed by findings such as those from Consumer Reports, which show that non-standardized naming leads to profound consumer confusion[^43]. Key mandates should include:
*   **Standardized Terminology:** Regulatory approval of clear, consistent names for ADAS features (e.g., "Adaptive Cruise Control" instead of proprietary terms) to manage consumer expectations[^43].
*   **Explicit ODD Disclosure:** Mandatory, clear communication of system limitations regarding weather, road types, and scenarios in owner's manuals and marketing materials.
*   **Intuitive HMI Design Standards:** Guidelines for in-vehicle alerts and status displays to ensure they are salient, understandable, and effective in maintaining driver situational awareness, thereby mitigating complacency[^43].

**3. Robust Certification, Validation, and Post-Market Integrity**
Ensuring systems are safe by design and remain safe after repairs and modifications is crucial for closing liability gaps. This pillar involves:
*   **Pre-market Validation:** Encouraging processes like the "safety case" assessment proposed in NHTSA's AV STEP program, where manufacturers must affirmatively demonstrate their system's safety to an independent entity[^44]. This moves beyond mere compliance checklisting to a holistic risk-based argument.
*   **Post-Repair Calibration Standards:** As identified in repair shop liability analyses, a vehicle can be physically compliant with FMVSS yet have dangerously misaligned ADAS sensors after a repair[^45]. Regulations must require and standardize calibration procedures, documentation, and technician certification. The SEMA-backed ADAS Functionality & Integrity Act, which calls for NHTSA to publish guidelines on how aftermarket modifications affect ADAS, is a positive step toward this[^46].
*   **Cybersecurity and Software Update Accountability:** The EU PLD's recognition that failure to provide necessary security updates can constitute a defect must be mirrored globally[^13]. Manufacturers must have a duty to maintain software integrity and be liable for harms resulting from known, unpatched vulnerabilities.

### 4.3 Balancing Innovation, Safety, and Stakeholder Interests in Regulatory Implementation

Implementing the proposed framework and pillars requires a strategic, collaborative approach that balances the needs of all stakeholders while maintaining a clear focus on safety and equity.

**Coordinated Regulatory Roles and Harmonization**
A fragmented, state-by-state approach creates uncertainty that stifles innovation and complicates liability. A more effective model involves:
*   **Federal Leadership (e.g., NHTSA):** Should establish **national performance standards** for ADAS/ADS, mandate uniform EDR standards, and create voluntary certification pathways like the proposed AV STEP program to accelerate safe deployment[^44]. NHTSA's role is to set the safety floor and facilitate innovation through clear, modernized rules.
*   **State Harmonization:** States should align their traffic laws and insurance requirements with the federal framework, moving away from contradictory definitions and rules. Their role should focus on licensing, enforcement, and regulating insurance within the national structure.
*   **International Alignment:** Regulators should actively engage with international bodies (e.g., UNECE) to harmonize core safety and data standards, preventing a regulatory race to the bottom and simplifying global development[^47].

**Learning from International Models: The EU PLD Example**
The United States can draw valuable lessons from the European Union's modernized Product Liability Directive. Its **rebuttable presumptions**—particularly the presumption of defect and causation when claimants face excessive difficulties due to technical complexity—directly address the evidentiary black box problem in ADAS litigation[^13]. While maintaining a fault-based system for driver actions, incorporating similar procedural safeguards for claims against manufacturers would help balance the scales without imposing outright strict liability for all harms.

**Targeted Stakeholder Recommendations**
*   **For Manufacturers:** Support a unified national regulatory framework that provides **ex-ante certainty** on performance expectations and liability thresholds. Proactively engage in transparency initiatives and invest in robust, verifiable safety cases for their systems. Embrace a duty of care for the entire human-machine collaborative system, including foreseeable misuse.
*   **For Insurers:** Develop new **data-driven risk models** leveraging standardized EDR outputs. Partner with regulators to define data parameters for liability assessment. Prepare for the transition from personal driver-centric policies to hybrid products that also cover manufacturer/system liability, as seen in the UK's model.
*   **For Consumers and Drivers:** Advocate for and utilize **mandatory transparency tools** (e.g., clear system capability disclosures). Recognize that while legal responsibility for supervision remains at Levels 0-2, over-reliance on marketing claims is a documented risk. Support educational initiatives on ADAS functionality and limitations.
*   **For Regulators:** Adopt an **iterative and collaborative rulemaking process** that keeps pace with technological evolution. Prioritize rules that generate actionable safety data (like enhanced EDRs) and clarify the boundaries of responsibility (like graduated liability triggers). Programs like NHTSA's proposed AV STEP, which combines a safety case with public data reporting, exemplify a balanced approach that can build public trust while fostering innovation[^44].

**Conclusion: A Path Forward**
The shared control paradigm of modern ADAS necessitates a fundamental evolution in liability allocation. The path forward lies in rejecting simplistic blame assignment in favor of a **multi-factor, graduated framework** that is technically grounded in SAE levels and legally operationalized through concepts like the "Computer Driver." This framework must be supported by non-negotiable pillars of data transparency, consumer understanding, and system integrity. By implementing these guidelines through coordinated, forward-looking regulation, policymakers can create an ecosystem that protects vulnerable road users, provides fair recourse for harm, offers clear rules for industry, and ultimately fulfills the safety promise of advanced vehicle technologies. The goal is not to stifle innovation but to channel it responsibly, ensuring that the journey toward automation is marked by clarity, equity, and trust.
