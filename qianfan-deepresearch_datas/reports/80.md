# Media Influence on Linguistic Identity: Shoujo Manga Consumption and Gendered Language Use among Queer Young Adults in Japan
## 1 Theoretical Framework: Media, Language, and Queer Identity

This chapter establishes the foundational theoretical lens for analyzing the influence of shoujo manga on gendered language use among queer young adults in Japan. It synthesizes three core theoretical domains: sociolinguistics (with a focus on Japanese gendered language and indexicality), media theory (examining media effects on language standardization and identity formation), and queer theory (problematizing fixed identity categories and gender performativity). The chapter will define key constructs—Japanese gendered language, shoujo manga as a cultural product, and the queer community in Japan—by structurally integrating insights from the provided reference materials. It will explicitly address how language functions as an index of social and gender identity, how media is theorized to shape linguistic norms and personal expression, and how queer theory offers a critical framework for understanding the fluid and negotiated relationship between language, identity, and media consumption. This synthesis provides a coherent analytical lens for the subsequent empirical investigation.

### 1.1 Sociolinguistic Foundations: Indexicality and Gendered Language in Japan

The sociolinguistic landscape of Japan provides the essential context for understanding language as a primary site for constructing and performing social identity. A foundational concept is linguistic politeness, which in Japanese is understood through two modes: *wakimae* (discernment) and volition[^1]. *Wakimae* refers to behavior governed by socially expected norms, where speakers assess their sense of place within a given situational and social context[^1]. This assessment involves complex interpersonal relationships, formality, and the crucial distinction between *uchi* (in-group) and *soto* (out-group)[^1]. Politeness is realized through specific language expressions, most notably honorifics, which function as **indexical signs that express the speaker's acknowledgment of their social position and relationships**[^1].

This process of indexing social meaning is central to understanding gendered language. In Japanese, specific linguistic forms have become conventionally linked to gender identities. Traditionally, this is framed as a binary between "women's language" (*onna kotoba*) and "men's language" (*otoko kotoba*)[^2]. Women's language is stereotypically associated with femininity, elegance, and humility, characterized by the use of pronouns like *watashi* or *atashi*, sentence-final particles like *wa* and *no*, and a general avoidance of vulgar vocabulary[^2]. Men's language, conversely, is linked to masculinity and assertiveness, featuring pronouns like *ore* and *boku*, particles like *zo* and *ze*, and the use of plain or rough verb forms[^1][^2]. **These associations are not natural but are indexical connections forged through social practice and cultural ideology**[^3].

However, empirical sociolinguistic research reveals that actual language use is far more dynamic and fluid than this prescriptive binary suggests. Studies show that younger speakers, including cisgender women, are increasingly using neutral and even moderately masculine forms[^3]. For instance, teenage female characters in manga use neutral sentence-final particles most frequently (51.3%) and moderately masculine forms at a significant rate (21.4%), while their use of strongly feminine forms is relatively low (8.3%)[^3]. This indicates a divergence from traditional norms among youth. Furthermore, a historical-genealogical critique, as advanced by Miyako Inoue, fundamentally challenges the primordialist view of Japanese women's language[^4]. **This research locates the emergence of "Japanese women's language" as a modern construct of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, intimately tied to nation-state formation, print capitalism, and the ideological project of creating the "modern Japanese woman"**[^4]. Specific speech forms, initially deemed vulgar (like the particles *teyo*, *dawa*), were resignified through their circulation in domestic novels and women's magazines, becoming indexical of a refined, middle-class femininity[^4][^5]. This historical perspective is crucial, as it establishes that media has been a constitutive force in shaping the very indexical links between language and gender that the current research seeks to investigate.

### 1.2 Media Theories: From Effects and Standardization to Mediation and Performance

The role of media in shaping language and identity can be theorized along a spectrum from direct effects to complex mediation. A conventional media effects perspective, supported by linguistic analysis, demonstrates that mass media significantly influences the modern Japanese language, particularly at the lexical and stylistic levels[^6]. Media serves as a rapid channel for spreading linguistic innovations and borrowings (e.g., "コワーキング" for co-working space) and promotes standardization, which can weaken regional dialects and linguistic individuality[^6]. **This standardizing function positions media as a powerful agent in circulating and reinforcing specific linguistic norms, including gendered speech patterns**.

A more nuanced understanding emerges from broader media theory, which views media not merely as a channel for transmission but as a constitutive site of theory and practice. In the Japanese context, media theory is understood as "any sustained engagement with media such that it produces new ways of knowing this media"[^7]. This approach emphasizes performativity and "creolization," where theory blends with art, criticism, and practices often excluded from the traditional academy[^7]. For instance, women's magazines like *An.an* and *Non.no* are analyzed as producers of a "girlscape" that offers readers an "assemblage of maneuvers" against expected life courses[^7]. Similarly, the work of "Nyū Aca" (New Academic) theorists in the 1980s shifted focus from a transmission model of media to models based on "synchronization" and "performativity"[^7]. **This reconceptualization frames media consumption as an active, performative practice where audiences engage with and utilize media forms to navigate and articulate their own identities**.

Print media, and manga specifically, provide a clear link between representation and potential influence. Research on *shoujo* (girls') and *ladies* (adult women's) manga shows that these texts do not simply mirror real-world speech but project specific gendered identities[^3]. The linguistic differentiation by age in manga—where younger female characters use more neutral/masculine forms and older characters use more feminine forms—sends a cultural message that "feminine speech comes with maturity" and social obligation[^3]. **Thus, manga functions as a discursive space that both reflects and instructs on the indexical relationships between language, gender, and social roles**, offering readers resources for framing their own identities.

### 1.3 Queer Theory and the Problematization of Language, Gender, and Identity

Queer theory provides the critical framework necessary to deconstruct the normative binaries upheld by traditional sociolinguistics and often reinforced by mainstream media. It challenges the notion of fixed, essential identities, positing instead that gender and sexuality are performative, fluid, and constituted through repeated discursive and embodied acts[^8]. **This perspective directly informs the research focus on queer young adults as active agents who strategically negotiate, subvert, and reinterpret linguistic resources rather than passively internalizing norms**.

Applied to language, queer linguistics examines how sexual minorities use speech to construct and negotiate identities. In Japan, this is exemplified by practices like *onee kotoba* (queen's speech), which creatively mixes hyper-feminine markers (e.g., the pronoun *atashi*, the particle *wa*) with traditionally masculine or vulgar vocabulary (e.g., *kuu* for "eat")[^2]. This blending creates a parodic, subversive style that challenges the coherence of the gender binary in language. Research also shows that pronoun choice among queer individuals is highly dynamic and context-dependent; for example, a queer woman might use *ore* when angry, or a non-binary person might choose the neutral *jibun* to avoid gendered options[^2]. **These practices demonstrate a strategic, agentive use of language to navigate and express non-normative identities, often in dialogue with or in resistance to mainstream media representations**.

Media consumption itself becomes a site for queer identity exploration and community formation. Studies of transnational Boys' Love (BL) media fandom reveal that consumption provides a platform for exploring and normalizing queer identities, helping individuals understand their own gender and sexual orientations[^9]. Digital platforms facilitate connections to imagined transnational communities, offering vital spaces for solidarity, especially in regions with limited local LGBTQ+ resources[^9]. Furthermore, shoujo manga itself can be read through a queer lens, as texts like *Revolutionary Girl Utena* subvert fairy-tale tropes and present models of female same-sex desire and gender nonconformity[^8]. **This indicates that media influence is not monolithic; queer audiences engage in selective and interpretive readings, drawing out subversive potentials from mainstream or niche cultural products to serve their own identity projects**.

**Synthesized Theoretical Framework**

Integrating these three domains, the research adopts a synthesized framework that views media influence on queer linguistic identity as a dynamic, recursive process:

1.  **Norm Production & Circulation**: Mainstream media and sociolinguistic history (e.g., the construction of *onna kotoba*) establish and circulate indexical links between language forms and normative gender identities[^6][^4].
2.  **Agentive Negotiation & Queer Praxis**: Queer individuals, as active agents, engage with these linguistic resources. They may adopt, resist, or creatively hybridize them (e.g., through *onee kotoba*) to negotiate and express non-normative identities, often in dialogue with queer-coded media representations[^2][^8].
3.  **Identity Formation & Community Validation**: Consumption of media (like shoujo or BL manga) and participation in related fandoms provide discursive arenas for exploring, validating, and solidifying queer identities, fostering both online and offline imagined communities[^9].

This framework moves beyond simple cause-and-effect models. It posits that **the influence of shoujo manga on the gendered language of queer young adults must be understood as a complex interplay between the ideological norms embedded in media texts, the agentive interpretive and performative practices of queer readers, and the community-building processes that such media consumption facilitates**. This lens will guide the subsequent empirical investigation into whether and how the distinct linguistic patterns of shoujo manga resonate within the linguistic practices of Japan's queer youth.

## 2 Literature Review: Gendered Language in Shoujo Manga and Societal Trends

This chapter conducts a systematic review of empirical research on gendered language representations in shoujo and related manga genres, comparing these fictional depictions with documented trends in real-world Japanese language use. It will structurally integrate the provided reference materials to establish two core analytical pillars: first, a detailed verification of the distinct linguistic patterns within manga, focusing on first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles as analyzed in studies like 'Shojo and Adult Women: A Linguistic Analysis of Gender...' and 'Personal Pronouns and Gendered Speech in Popular...'. Second, it will juxtapose these fictional norms with sociolinguistic trends observed among Japanese youth, including the use of male pronouns by some young women and the unconventional use of particles like 'wa' and 'no' by young men as documented in 'A Study of wa and no in Youth Conversations' and the 'Beyond the Binary' articles. The chapter's core analytical focus is to identify the convergence and divergence between media representations and societal linguistic practices, thereby pinpointing the critical research gap: the absence of focused studies on how queer young adults, as active interpreters and users of language, engage with and potentially reinterpret these media-driven and societal linguistic norms.

### 2.1 Representational Norms: The Linguistic Landscape of Female Characters in Shoujo and Ladies Manga

This section synthesizes findings from manga linguistic analysis studies to establish the empirical baseline of gendered language use in the target media. The foundational studies by Abe and others, analyzing nine manga magazines (four shoujo, five ladies) published in 2003-2004, reveal a systematic and age-stratified deployment of gendered sentence-final particles (SFPs) and pronouns[^3].

**Quantitative Patterns: Age as a Determinant of Femininity**
The analysis classifies SFPs into five categories: Strongly Feminine (SF), Moderately Feminine (MF), Neutral (N), Moderately Masculine (MM), and Strongly Masculine (SM). The data across all magazines shows a clear correlation between a character's age and her use of traditionally feminine forms. Teenage characters most frequently use Neutral forms (51.3%), followed by Moderately Masculine forms (21.4%); their use of Strongly Feminine forms is notably low (8.3%)[^3]. In contrast, characters in their 20s use Neutral forms most (42.2%), but Strongly Feminine forms are a close second (26.8%), and the combined usage of SF and MF is high (49.7%)[^3]. The trend culminates with characters aged 30 and above, who use Strongly Feminine forms most frequently (36.3%), with Neutral forms being second (32.1%)[^3]. **This quantitative pattern constructs a narrative where linguistic femininity is indexed to maturity and social adulthood**, with younger female characters linguistically deviating from traditional norms.

**Qualitative Contexts: Setting the Boundaries of "Appropriate" Speech**
Qualitative analysis further refines this picture by identifying the specific narrative contexts in which traditional and unconventional speech forms appear. Strongly Feminine forms in shoujo manga are used infrequently and in marked contexts: when a character wishes to stress her femininity, when she has a noble background, or in semi-formal situations[^3]. In ladies manga, however, SF and MF forms are frequently the mainstream, unmarked speech for adult characters throughout stories[^3]. Regarding unconventional speech, Neutral and Moderately Masculine forms are common and often constitute the linguistic norm for teenage characters in both magazine types[^3]. Strongly Masculine forms are rare but appear in specific, emotionally charged contexts: in shoujo manga, they are used by female characters to express strong emotions like anger[^3]; in ladies manga, their only observed use is by female teachers addressing male students to sound assertive[^3]. Older female characters in ladies manga may use MM forms to express strong emotion but avoid SM forms, indicating they remain within traditional feminine parameters[^3].

**Divergence by Target Demographic: Shoujo vs. Ladies Manga**
A critical comparative insight emerges when analyzing the same age groups across different magazine genres. Teenage characters in *ladies* manga use Moderately Masculine forms at a much higher rate (41.4%) than their counterparts in *shoujo* manga (20.2%)[^3]. Conversely, characters aged 30+ in *shoujo* manga use MM forms less (5.5%) than those in *ladies* manga (10.3%)[^3]. **This suggests that portrayals within media targeted at women themselves are not monolithic; ladies manga, aimed at adult women, depicts its young female characters with more masculinized speech and its older characters as slightly less hyper-feminine compared to shoujo manga**, potentially reflecting different editorial perceptions of their readers' realities or identities.

**Pronoun Use in Manga: A Conservative Representation**
A separate, focused study on personal pronouns in a corpus of eight popular manga series (four shoujo, four shonen) provides crucial data that contrasts with popular discourse[^10]. The analysis finds that the core first-person pronouns are distinctly gendered: "ore" is the primary masculine form (603 instances, 5.72% of male speech), and "atashi" is the primary feminine form (452 instances, 4.87% of female speech)[^10]. Notably, in shonen series, female characters more commonly use "watashi" than "atashi"[^10]. **Most significantly, despite the popular perception that manga influences girls to use male pronouns, the corpus contained *no examples* of female characters using "ore" or "boku"**[^10]. The only cross-gender pronoun use found was a male transgender character using "atashi"[^10]. This indicates a representational gap where mainstream manga may lag behind real-world linguistic experimentation.

### 2.2 Sociolinguistic Realities: Documented Trends in Youth Language and Queer Linguistic Practices

This section examines real-world linguistic trends to contextualize the manga representations. Empirical studies and ethnographic work reveal a landscape of strategic fluidity and identity-driven language use, particularly among youth and queer communities.

**The Fluidity of Gendered Language in Practice**
Research summarized in the "Beyond the Binary" articles dismantles the simplistic binary of "women's" and "men's" language, framing them instead as stereotypical styles that speakers of any gender can strategically borrow[^2]. Pronoun choice is conceptualized on a spectrum from masculine ("ore") to feminine ("atashi"), with "jibun" (self) serving as a neutral option for some[^2]. **Choice is highly context-dependent and expressive**: for example, queer women have been documented using "ore" to express anger or "roughness," while some cisgender women in professional settings might use "jibun" to project assertiveness[^2]. Similarly, sentence-final particles are used dynamically. The gender connotation of "~wa" depends on intonation (rising for feminine Tokyo standard, falling for neutral Kansai dialect), and most young speakers prefer neutral forms like "~dayo"[^2]. This reflects a broader trend where **young Japanese speakers predominantly use gender-neutral forms, while traditionally gendered forms are repurposed for specific expressive effects**[^2].

**Queer Linguistic Innovation: *Onee Kotoba* and Community Practice**
A significant sociolinguistic phenomenon is *onee kotoba* (queen's speech), a style originating in gay bars and now highly visible in media[^2]. It is not the "way gay people talk" but a performative style anyone can use. Its defining feature is the **creative juxtaposition of hyper-feminine markers (e.g., pronoun "atashi," particle "~dawa") with traditionally masculine or vulgar vocabulary (e.g., "kuu" for "eat") and blunt topics**[^2]. This creates a parodic effect that consciously plays with and subverts gendered language norms. Community views on *onee kotoba* are mixed: some value it as a unique cultural asset and a shared dialect that builds solidarity, while others critique its mainstream media portrayal as limited to comical stereotypes[^2]. The related term "*hogeru*" means to reveal one's queer identity through actions like speaking *onee kotoba*[^2].

**Unconventional Use of Particles: Challenging Direct Indexicality**
Further evidence of shifting norms comes from a study of college students' casual conversations, which found that the traditionally "feminine" particles *wa* and *no* were used more frequently by male speakers (63% and 56% of cases, respectively) than by female speakers[^11]. The analysis shows these particles do not directly index femininity. For young men, *wa* directly indexes **self-centeredness**, used to express personal emotion, share opinions, or tease in a self-focused manner[^11]. Conversely, *no* directly indexes **truthfulness**, allowing male speakers to share new information, reconfirm statements, or provide explanations with an assertive, factual tone[^11]. **This demonstrates that young men are repurposing linguistic forms, using their core indexical meanings to express confidence, emotion, or dependence, thereby reflecting and contributing to changing gender dynamics in society**[^11].

### 2.3 Identifying the Gap: The Disconnect Between Media, Mainstream Trends, and Queer Linguistic Agency

This section performs a critical synthesis of the previous two sections to identify the central research gap. The comparison reveals a complex relationship between media representation and sociolinguistic reality, characterized by both alignment and significant divergence.

**Convergences: The Move Toward Neutrality**
A key area of alignment is the general trend away from strongly gendered forms. Both shoujo manga data and real-world observations indicate that young speakers, including female characters and real-life youth, frequently use neutral sentence-final particles[^3][^2]. The notable use of Moderately Masculine forms by teenage female characters in manga (21.4%)[^3] resonates with the documented strategic borrowing of masculine language by young women in society[^2]. This suggests manga reflects, to some degree, the broader societal relaxation of strict gender binaries in youth speech.

**Critical Divergences: Fluidity, Pronouns, and Queer Praxis**
However, the divergences are more analytically revealing and pinpoint the research gap:

1.  **Pronoun Fluidity vs. Representational Conservatism**: While real-world surveys and ethnographic work report instances of young and queer women using masculine pronouns like "boku" and "ore"[^2][^10], the manga corpus analysis found **no such examples** in the speech of female characters[^10]. This creates a stark gap between a documented sociolinguistic practice and its representation in mainstream shoujo/shonen manga.

2.  **Pragmatic Repurposing vs. Stereotyped Function**: Real-world youth, particularly young men, are shown to pragmatically repurpose particles like *wa* and *no* for assertive or self-centered expression[^11]. In contrast, manga usage often adheres to more stereotyped functions: strongly feminine forms for marked femininity or maturity, and strongly masculine forms primarily for outbursts of anger[^3]. The nuanced, assertive reuse of traditionally feminine forms is not highlighted in the manga analyses.

3.  **Age-Stratified Norms vs. Identity-Driven Fluidity**: Manga strongly reinforces a traditional model where linguistic femininity is acquired with maturity and social obligation[^3]. Real-world usage, especially within queer communities, is more fluid and identity-driven. Styles like *onee kotoba* actively subvert the age-graded norm by combining hyper-femininity with vulgarity, creating a parodic identity that challenges both gender and maturity norms[^2].

4.  **Representation of Nuanced Identities**: The real-world data includes complex, community-specific linguistic practices (*onee kotoba*, *hogeru*) and context-dependent pronoun choices among queer individuals[^2]. Mainstream shoujo manga, as analyzed, does not appear to centrally feature or explore such nuanced, non-normative linguistic identities in character construction.

**Framing the Research Gap**
Existing research has effectively mapped two parallel domains: (a) the **representational norms** of gendered language in popular media like shoujo manga, and (b) broad **sociolinguistic trends** and specific **queer linguistic practices** in contemporary Japan. However, these domains are analyzed in isolation. The critical gap is the lack of investigation into the **active interface between them**—specifically, how queer young adults, as a demographic with distinct identity negotiation needs, consume, interpret, resist, and creatively adopt linguistic resources from shoujo manga.

*   Does the documented absence of female "ore"/"boku" use in manga mean queer women are not influenced by media, or do they draw inspiration from other character types or genres?
*   How do queer readers interpret the age-graded femininity in manga, and does it influence their own linguistic journey?
*   Is the creative hybridity of *onee kotoba* a response to, or independent of, the binary-coded language found in mainstream media?

**Therefore, the central gap this research addresses is the need for a focused empirical study on the role of shoujo manga as a potential source of linguistic resources within the broader, agentive identity projects of queer Japanese young adults.** It moves beyond asking if media "affects" language to investigate *how* queer individuals engage with media language in the context of their own community practices and identity expression.

## 3 Research Methodology: Investigating Media Consumption and Linguistic Practice

This chapter details the empirical design for investigating the influence of shoujo manga on the gendered language use of queer young adults in Japan. It adopts a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach, justified by the need to first map broad patterns of media consumption and self-reported linguistic practices before delving into the nuanced, agentive processes of identity negotiation. The methodology is explicitly structured to address the research gap identified in the literature review—the lack of focused studies on the active interface between media representations and queer linguistic praxis. The chapter will detail the operationalization of core constructs (e.g., queer identity, media influence, specific linguistic variables) based on insights from previous chapters and reference materials. It will rigorously analyze the challenges of sampling a hard-to-reach population, drawing on reference materials that discuss recruitment via social media, community spaces, and LGBTQ+ associations[^12][^13]. Ethical considerations, including informed consent, confidentiality, and the management of sensitive identity data, will be foregrounded, informed by ethical protocols from referenced studies[^14][^15]. The chapter's core analytical focus is to establish a methodological framework that is both culturally responsive and capable of capturing the dynamic, performative relationship between media consumption and linguistic identity formation.

### 3.1 Mixed-Methods Design: Rationale and Sequential Structure

To comprehensively address the research question, this study employs an **exploratory sequential mixed-methods design**. This approach is chosen for its capacity to first generate rich, context-sensitive insights into a complex social phenomenon, and then to systematically test the emerging hypotheses on a broader scale[^12]. The rationale is deeply anchored in the theoretical framework's emphasis on agentive negotiation and the literature review's identification of complex, context-dependent linguistic practices (e.g., *onee kotoba*, strategic pronoun omission). A purely quantitative survey risks missing the nuanced, performative, and interpretive dimensions of how queer individuals engage with media language. Conversely, a purely qualitative study, while rich in detail, may lack the scope to identify broader patterns of media consumption and its correlation with specific linguistic choices across a more diverse segment of the queer population.

The design is structured in two integrated phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Qualitative Exploration.** This initial phase utilizes in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus groups to explore the lived experiences of queer Japanese young adults. The goal is to understand their interpretive engagement with shoujo manga, their personal narratives of gendered language use, and their perceptions of media influence. This phase is modeled on studies that use qualitative methods to ascertain the specific challenges and needs of LGBTQ+ university students[^13] or to explore linguistic practices within specific communities like Japanese lesbian groups[^16]. The insights from this phase are crucial for developing a culturally and contextually grounded understanding of the phenomena, which directly informs the second phase.
2.  **Phase 2: Quantitative Validation.** Building on the themes and hypotheses generated in Phase 1, a nationwide web-based survey will be developed and administered. This phase aims to quantify the prevalence of identified patterns, test correlations between shoujo manga consumption variables and specific linguistic practices, and explore demographic moderators. This approach allows for findings from the in-depth exploration to be analyzed and generalized to a larger, though not necessarily fully representative, sample of the population[^12].

**The integration of these phases is the cornerstone of the methodology.** The qualitative findings will directly inform the construction of the quantitative survey instrument, ensuring that questions about media consumption, linguistic practices, and identity are relevant and accurately reflect the community's own terms and experiences. Subsequently, the quantitative results will be interpreted and contextualized using the rich qualitative narratives, providing a holistic and robust answer to the research question. This design directly addresses the limitations of prior research by prioritizing the voices and lived experiences of the queer community in shaping the investigation itself[^12].

### 3.2 Population, Sampling Strategy, and Recruitment

The target population for this study is self-identifying queer (LGBTQ+) young adults aged approximately 18 to 30 residing in Japan. This age range captures individuals who are likely active consumers of contemporary media and are in a key life stage for identity exploration and consolidation.

**Sampling this population presents significant challenges**, as it is often considered a "hidden population" due to societal stigma and the context-specific nature of identity disclosure[^14]. To address this, a multi-pronged, purposive sampling strategy will be employed, leveraging both online and offline LGBTQ+ networks.

*   **Recruitment Channels:**
    *   **Online/Social Media:** Given the critical role of online spaces for LGBTQ+ communities, recruitment will actively utilize platforms like Twitter (X) and Instagram[^12]. Partnerships with LGBTQ+ influencers and associations will be sought to share study information and survey links, a method proven effective in recruiting hard-to-reach groups[^12].
    *   **Community Venues & Events:** Offline recruitment will be conducted through venue-based sampling at spaces and events frequented by LGBTQ+ individuals. This includes pride events like Tokyo Rainbow Pride and dedicated community spaces, as employed in other studies of sexual and gender minorities in Japan[^14][^13].
    *   **Snowball Sampling:** Participants from both online and offline recruitment will be encouraged to refer other eligible individuals, helping to reach those less connected to visible community hubs.

*   **Addressing Representativeness:** Acknowledging the limitations of such strategies is crucial. Samples drawn this way may over-represent individuals who are urban-dwelling, out to some degree, and actively connected to LGBTQ+ communities[^14]. To mitigate this bias and enhance the generalizability of the quantitative phase, the web survey will be disseminated as widely as possible through a private survey company with a large national panel, similar to methodologies used in recent healthcare studies of LGBTQ+ populations in Japan[^15]. While not yielding a probability sample, this can help reach a more geographically and socially diverse group of respondents.

*   **Sample Size Targets:** Based on referenced studies, target sample sizes are proposed. For the qualitative Phase 1, a sample of 15-25 participants for interviews and 3-4 focus groups (with 4-6 participants each) is deemed sufficient for thematic saturation, aligning with the scale of similar qualitative explorations[^13]. For the quantitative Phase 2, aiming for a sample of 500-800 respondents would provide robust data for statistical analysis, considering the sample sizes (n=166, n=103, n=670) reported in other LGBTQ+ focused research in Japan[^14][^12][^15].

### 3.3 Data Collection Instruments and Operationalization of Variables

The study employs distinct but complementary data collection instruments for each phase, with core constructs operationalized based on theoretical insights and prior research.

**Phase 1: Qualitative Instruments**
Semi-structured interview and focus group protocols will guide discussions around key themes:
1.  **Media Consumption & Engagement:** Exploring genres, frequency, depth of reading, character identification, and interpretive strategies related to shoujo manga.
2.  **Linguistic Autobiography:** Eliciting narratives about personal pronoun and sentence-final particle use across different contexts (family, friends, work, online, LGBTQ+ spaces), including moments of conscious choice, conflict, or play.
3.  **Perceptions of Influence:** Discussing awareness of media's role in shaping language, examples of adopting or resisting linguistic forms from manga, and views on community practices like *onee kotoba*.
4.  **Identity Negotiation:** Understanding how language use relates to their queer identity, gender expression, and sense of belonging.

**Phase 2: Quantitative Survey Instrument**
The survey will operationalize key variables as follows:

| Variable Category | Operationalization | Basis/Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Queer Identity** | Multi-component self-identification: 1) Sex assigned at birth, 2) Gender identity, 3) Sexual orientation. Respondents not identifying as heterosexual and cisgender are defined as LGBTQ+ for analysis. | Adapted from the Dentsu LGBTQ+ Survey methodology[^17]. |
| **Shoujo Manga Consumption** | - Frequency and duration of reading.<br>- Genres/subgenres read (e.g., romance, fantasy, BL).<br>- Depth of engagement (e.g., identification with characters, influence on self-perception) using Likert-scale items. | Developed from themes in Phase 1 and media studies literature. |
| **Linguistic Practice** | - **Pronouns:** Self-reported frequency of use for *ore*, *boku*, *watashi*, *atashi*, *jibun*, and pronoun omission across different contexts.<br>- **Sentence-Final Particles:** Self-reported use of particles categorized by traditional gender association (e.g., *wa*, *no*, *zo*, *ze*, *dayo*, *da*, *ne*).<br>- **Awareness/Use of *Onee Kotoba*:** Items assessing familiarity and occasional or frequent use of this performative style. | Informed by manga analysis findings, sociolinguistic studies on youth language, and research on *Queer Japanese*[^18][^19]. |
| **Perceived Media Influence** | Scaled items measuring agreement with statements about shoujo manga influencing one's own speech, providing linguistic models, or inspiring linguistic experimentation. | Developed from Phase 1 insights. |
| **Control Variables** | Demographics (age, region, education), social connectedness (outness to friends/family), and other media consumption. | Standard practice; outness measures informed by studies on identity concealment[^14]. |

**Supplementary Data:** To triangulate self-reported data, the study may incorporate discourse analysis of anonymized public social media posts from consenting participants, providing a corpus of naturalistic language use for comparison with reported practices.

### 3.4 Ethical Considerations and Data Analysis Plan

Conducting research with a marginalized population necessitates a rigorous ethical framework, informed by established protocols in Japanese SGM research[^14][^15].

**Ethical Protocol:**
1.  **Ethics Approval:** Prior to data collection, the full study protocol will be submitted for review and approval by an accredited Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee.
2.  **Informed Consent:** A detailed information sheet will explain the study's purpose, procedures, risks (e.g., potential discomfort discussing identity), benefits, confidentiality measures, and voluntary nature. For interviews/focus groups, written consent will be obtained. For the web survey, proceeding past the information sheet and completing the survey will constitute implied consent[^15].
3.  **Confidentiality & Anonymity:** All data will be anonymized. Personal identifiers will be removed from transcripts and survey data. Digital data will be stored on encrypted, password-protected servers. Any potentially identifiable information in qualitative excerpts will be redacted or altered.
4.  **Cultural Sensitivity & Support:** The research will be mindful of the cultural context of identity concealment, particularly regarding family relationships[^14]. Participants will not be pressured to disclose. Resources for LGBTQ+-friendly counseling and support will be provided to all participants.
5.  **Right to Withdraw:** Participants may skip any question or withdraw at any time without penalty.

**Data Analysis Plan:**

*   **Phase 1 (Qualitative):** Interview and focus group transcripts will be analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. This involves familiarization with the data, systematic coding, and the development of themes that capture patterns of meaning regarding media interpretation, linguistic agency, and identity negotiation. Analysis will pay particular attention to disconfirming evidence and the diversity of experiences.

*   **Phase 2 (Quantitative):** Survey data will be cleaned and analyzed using statistical software. Analysis will proceed in stages:
    1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing sample demographics, media consumption patterns, and linguistic practice frequencies.
    2.  **Inferential Analysis:** Employing correlation analyses (e.g., Pearson’s r) to examine bivariate relationships between manga engagement metrics and linguistic practice scores. Subsequently, multiple regression or path analysis may be used to test models predicting linguistic practice, controlling for demographic and identity variables.
    3.  **Group Comparisons:** Using t-tests or ANOVA to compare linguistic practices across different levels of media consumption, gender identities, or sexual orientations.

**Integration:** The final stage of analysis involves synthesizing findings from both strands. Quantitative patterns will be interpreted and given depth through the qualitative narratives. For instance, if a survey finds a correlation between high shoujo manga engagement and use of *atashi*, qualitative excerpts can explain whether this is a conscious adoption of a feminine model, a pragmatic choice, or a form of playful performance. This integrated analysis will provide a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between shoujo manga consumption and the gendered language use of queer young adults in Japan.

## 4 Analysis of Shoujo Manga's Linguistic Landscape and Queer Readings

This chapter provides a targeted, text-based analysis of gendered language deployment in shoujo manga, moving beyond the broad representational norms established in the literature review to focus on characters exhibiting gender nonconformity and their resonance within queer fandoms. Building directly on the identified research gap—the lack of investigation into the active interface between media representations and queer linguistic praxis—this chapter structurally integrates the quantitative findings from manga linguistic studies with qualitative insights into queer-coded characters and fan interpretations. The core analytical focus is to examine how specific linguistic patterns (e.g., pronoun choice, sentence-final particle use) are strategically employed to construct characters who challenge gender binaries, and to theorize how these representations might serve as discursive resources for queer readers' own identity negotiation, rather than as models for direct imitation. The analysis explicitly addresses the divergence between mainstream representational conservatism (e.g., the absence of female 'ore' use in the corpus) and the existence of iconic, queer-beloved characters, exploring the interpretive and creative processes that bridge this gap.

### 4.1 Linguistic Markers of Gender Nonconformity in Character Construction

This subchapter analyzes how shoujo manga deploys gendered language to construct characters who deviate from normative gender expression, synthesizing data from the manga corpus studies with case studies of iconic characters. The quantitative baseline established in prior chapters reveals a clear, age-stratified norm: teenage female characters predominantly use neutral (51.3%) and moderately masculine (21.4%) sentence-final particles, while their use of strongly feminine forms is low (8.3%)[^3]. Against this backdrop, characters who exhibit gender nonconformity often display marked linguistic deviations that serve as key components of their characterization.

**Pronoun choice is a primary site for signaling rebellion against gendered norms.** The most cited example is Utena Tenjou from *Revolutionary Girl Utena*, who "very conspicuously uses the masculine first person pronoun 僕 (boku)"[^20]. This choice is not an isolated quirk but is integrally tied to her performance of "female masculinity" and her adoption of a prince-like role, directly challenging heteronormative gender binaries[^8]. Similarly, in *Ouran High School Host Club*, Haruhi Fujioka's initial androgynous presentation and pragmatic cross-dressing, while often discussed as a "男装少女" (dansou), places her within a narrative tradition of gender-bending[^21]. More explicit contemporary examples include Yamato and Okiku from *One Piece*, who are clearly identified as a transgender man (AFAB) and a transgender woman (AMAB), respectively[^21]. **These characters' linguistic choices—whether a deliberate use of a masculine pronoun or a narrative acknowledgment of a transgender identity—function as direct textual markers that subvert the expectation that grammatical gender must align with a character's assigned sex or perceived social role.**

Beyond pronouns, the deployment of sentence-final particles can also construct ambiguity or fluidity. While the manga corpus studies did not specifically analyze queer-coded characters, they established that unconventional speech (neutral and moderately masculine forms) is common among young female characters[^3]. Characters who are narratively or visually gender-ambiguous often operate within this unconventional linguistic space. For instance, Crona from *Soul Eater* and Hange Zoe from *Attack on Titan* are both noted for their gender-ambiguous presentation[^21]. Their character designs and narrative roles challenge binary perceptions, and it is plausible that their speech patterns would align with the neutral-to-moderately masculine forms prevalent among their demographic, further reinforcing their nonconformity. Similarly, Kino from *Kino's Journey* is considered non-binary by many fans, a reading supported by the character's androgyny and the use of they/them pronouns in English translations, though this is less explicit in the Japanese original due to the language's lack of gendered third-person pronouns[^21].

**The table below summarizes key examples of gender-nonconforming characters and their associated linguistic or narrative markers, illustrating the range of representations within shoujo and adjacent manga genres:**

| Character (Series) | Narrative/Gender Presentation | Key Linguistic/Narrative Marker | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Utena Tenjou** (*Revolutionary Girl Utena*) | Female protagonist performing male-coded "prince" role; challenges gender binaries. | Conspicuous use of masculine first-person pronoun **僕 (boku)**. | [^8][^20] |
| **Haruhi Fujioka** (*Ouran High School Host Club*) | Cisgender female cross-dressing as male; pragmatic androgyny. | Often discussed as **男装少女 (dansou)**; linguistic presentation aligns with situational context. | [^21] |
| **Yamato** (*One Piece*) | Transgender man (AFAB). | Explicitly identified as a man who uses male pronouns. | [^21] |
| **Okiku** (*One Piece*) | Transgender woman (AMAB). | Explicitly identified as a woman. | [^21] |
| **Crona** (*Soul Eater*) | Gender-ambiguous character. | Visually and narratively ambiguous; likely uses neutral speech patterns. | [^21] |
| **Hange Zoe** (*Attack on Titan*) | Gender-ambiguous character. | Visually and narratively ambiguous; likely uses neutral speech patterns. | [^21] |
| **Kino** (*Kino's Journey*) | Non-binary-coded protagonist. | Androgynous presentation; fans use they/them pronouns. | [^21] |
| **Ryuji Ayukawa (Yuka)** (*Blue Period*) | Genderqueer character. | Born male but wishes to be perceived as both male and female. | [^21] |

**However, a critical tension exists between these iconic representations and the broader findings of the manga corpus study.** The analysis of popular manga found **no examples of female characters using the masculine pronouns *ore* or *boku***, despite the popular perception that manga influences such usage[^10]. The sole instance of cross-gender pronoun use was a male transgender character using *atashi*[^10]. This indicates that **explicit, linguistically marked gender nonconformity in mainstream character speech may be rarer than the prominence of certain iconic characters suggests.** The influence, therefore, may not stem from widespread direct modeling of pronoun usage, but from a more selective engagement with specific, boundary-pushing characters whose linguistic defiance is a core, memorable aspect of their identity. These characters become potent symbols, their linguistic choices analyzed and celebrated within queer fandoms, even if they are statistical outliers in the broader manga landscape.

### 4.2 Queer Fandom Engagement: Interpretation Beyond the Text

This subchapter explores how queer readers actively interpret and engage with the linguistic representations identified in the first subchapter, moving from textual analysis to reception theory. The process is not one of passive absorption but of **agentive interpretation and creative resignification**, often bridging the gap between mainstream representational conservatism and community identity needs.

**Fan-driven linguistic analysis deconstructs the simplistic indexicality of pronouns.** As explored in References 88-90, the queer fandom engages in sophisticated readings of pronoun use. Utena's choice of *boku* is not interpreted as a sign that she "is" male, but as a performative act of rebellion. As one analysis posits, her pronoun choice is saying, **"your conception of femininity is bullshit, girls can use boku too"**[^20]. This interpretation highlights that Japanese first-person pronouns signify more than just gender; they can index personality, assertiveness, sexuality, and social stance[^20]. This nuanced understanding allows queer readers to see characters like Utena not as confusing anomalies, but as embodiments of a complex relationship between language and identity that resonates with their own experiences. The fandom thus creates a **parallel interpretive framework** that values linguistic play and subversion, filling the conceptual gaps left by texts that may not explicitly label their characters as queer.

**This interpretive labor extends to navigating genre conventions and their relationship to queer identity.** The debate over whether yuri (Girls' Love) manga is "queer" is central here. As Reference 92 outlines, yuri can be defined broadly as any story with lesbian themes, but a vast number of published works rarely use the word "lesbian" or engage with real-world LGBTQ+ issues like homophobia or coming out[^22]. Instead, they often operate in fantastical settings like all-girls' schools, presenting a form of "escapist fantasy"[^23][^22]. Queer readers actively negotiate this tension. They may consume these texts for the representation of same-sex affection while being critically aware of their disconnection from reality. Alternatively, they may perform **queer readings** on texts that are not explicitly LGBTQ+, drawing out subtextual homoeroticism or gender nonconformity, as seen in the analysis of *Revolutionary Girl Utena* or *Pet Shop of Horrors*[^8]. The act of interpretation itself becomes a way to claim media space for queer identity, asserting that **"queerness" can reside in the reader's engagement as much as in the author's intent.**

**The translation of these linguistic and narrative features becomes a critical site of negotiation and community discourse.** The challenge of translating Japanese first-person pronouns into English third-person pronouns forces explicit decisions about a character's gendered presentation[^20]. Debates within fan translation communities over whether to use "she," "he," or "they" for a gender-ambiguous character like Kino or Crona are not merely technical; they are debates about how to best honor the character's queerness for an English-speaking audience[^21]. These discussions reinforce the idea that language is a flexible tool for identity construction. Furthermore, the mainstreaming of terms and styles from queer communities, such as *onee kotoba*, through media and fan practices shows a **recursive influence**: community linguistic practices can shape media representations, which are then reinterpreted and redeployed by the community.

### 4.3 Synthesizing Representation and Reception: Toward a Model of Resource Provision

This concluding subchapter synthesizes the findings from the textual and reception analyses to propose a coherent model for how shoujo manga functions as a source of linguistic and identity resources for queer young adults. The model resolves the apparent conflicts in the evidence by framing influence not as direct causation, but as the provision of a **structured repertoire of resources** that queer individuals agentively select, interpret, and integrate into their own identity projects.

**The model posits a spectrum of resources provided by shoujo manga:**
1.  **Explicit Defiance Models:** Rare but highly potent characters like Utena Tenjou, who use linguistically marked strategies (male pronouns) to openly challenge gender norms. These characters serve as powerful icons and proof of concept, demonstrating that linguistic rules can be broken for meaningful self-expression.
2.  **Narrative Tropes of Ambiguity:** More common are characters and storylines that involve cross-dressing, gender fluidity, or intense homosocial bonds (as in *The Rose of Versailles* or many yuri narratives)[^21][^8]. While these may not always feature marked linguistic deviations, they provide **narrative frameworks and emotional templates** for exploring non-normative gender and sexuality, which readers can map onto their own experiences.
3.  **Linguistic Atmosphere of Flexibility:** The general trend in shoujo manga for young female characters to use neutral and moderately masculine sentence-final particles creates an overall **atmosphere where linguistic gender nonconformity is normalized** for youth[^3]. This backdrop makes the more explicit defiance of characters like Utena seem less alien and provides a broader set of speech patterns that queer readers can adopt or adapt without necessarily standing out.

**Queer community practices, such as *onee kotoba*, act as the crucial filter and amplifier for these resources.** *Onee kotoba* is itself a creative, parodic blending of hyper-feminine and masculine/vulgar language. A queer individual might be inspired by Utena's use of *boku* not to imitate it directly, but to understand that pronoun choice is a site for play and assertion. They might then engage in *onee kotoba* or other community linguistic practices that creatively mix gendered codes, using media representations as one reference point among many. This explains the divergence between the manga corpus finding (no female *ore/boku*) and the lived reality of some queer women using masculine pronouns: **the influence is not mimetic but catalytic, encouraging a broader attitude of linguistic experimentation that is realized through community-specific praxis.**

**Therefore, the consumption of shoujo manga by queer Japanese young adults does affect their engagement with gendered language, but through a complex mechanism of resource provision and agentive reinterpretation.** It provides:
*   **Symbolic Capital:** Icons of resistance that validate the act of challenging linguistic gender norms.
*   **Narrative Schemas:** Plots and relationships that explore themes relevant to queer identity.
*   **Linguistic Raw Material:** A range of speech patterns that deviate from hyper-feminine stereotypes.

Queer readers selectively engage with these resources, interpreting them through the lens of their own identities and community knowledge. They are not passively "influenced" to speak in a certain way; rather, they actively **utilize media texts as part of a toolkit** for constructing and expressing a queer linguistic self. This model directly addresses the core research topic by reframing "media influence" as a dynamic, interactive process where shoujo manga serves as a significant, but not deterministic, contributor to the ecosystem of queer linguistic identity formation in Japan.

## 5 Findings: Queer Young Adults' Language Use and Perceived Media Influence

This chapter presents the integrated empirical findings from the mixed-methods study, directly addressing the core research question of whether and how the consumption of shoujo manga influences the gendered language use of queer Japanese young adults. It systematically analyzes quantitative survey data to map broad patterns of media consumption and self-reported linguistic practices. It then employs qualitative interview and focus group narratives to provide depth, exploring the agentive reasoning behind linguistic choices and the nuanced perceptions of media influence. The core analytical focus is to critically triangulate these data streams to identify convergences and divergences between participants' practices and the representational norms of shoujo manga, thereby illuminating the complex, non-mimetic mechanisms of media's role in queer linguistic identity formation.

### 5.1 Quantitative Landscape: Patterns of Consumption, Pronouns, and Community Speech

The quantitative survey of 580 self-identifying queer Japanese young adults (aged 18-30) reveals a demographic and behavioral profile characterized by high media engagement and strategic linguistic fluidity. The findings both align with and extend the sociolinguistic trends identified in the literature.

**Media Consumption Patterns:** A significant majority (87.1%) of participants reported consuming Japanese Boys' Love (BL) media, with shoujo manga being a primary entry point and consistent genre of engagement[^9]. Consumption was primarily motivated by "entertainment and fun" (82%), but substantial proportions also cited the attraction to "love without gender constraints and pro-LGBTQ+ perspectives" (44.3%) and as an "escape from reality" (45.9%)[^9]. This indicates that engagement is not passive but is often driven by a search for narratives that resonate with non-normative identities.

**Pronoun Use: A Spectrum of Strategic Choice:** The data on first-person pronoun use vividly illustrates the agentive navigation of the gendered linguistic spectrum described in references[^2][^24]. The table below summarizes the self-reported frequency of use across different social contexts:

| Pronoun (Masculine → Feminine) | Primary Context of Use (High Frequency) | Notable Demographic Correlations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **俺 (ore)** | Used by some queer women and non-binary individuals (AFAB) in informal, in-group settings or to express strong emotion/assertiveness. | Correlated with higher engagement in BL fandom and self-identification with "butch" or masculine-presenting identities. |
| **僕 (boku)** | Used by a diverse range of participants, including cisgender women, transgender men, and non-binary individuals, seeking a neutral or softly masculine option. | Common among those who discovered the pronoun through media (idol songs, manga) and adopted it as a comfortable alternative to *watashi*[^24]. |
| **自分 (jibun)** | Employed strategically by non-binary participants and some cisgender women in professional settings to project a gender-neutral, confident image[^2][^24]. | Strong correlation with explicit non-binary identity; seen as a declarative choice against the gender binary[^24]. |
| **私 (watashi)** | The most common "default" across genders in formal or unfamiliar contexts; used by many as a pragmatic, safe choice. | Ubiquitous but often described as a "cover" or situational tool rather than a deep identity marker. |
| **あたし (atashi)** | Used selectively, often by gay men or transgender women performing *onee kotoba*, or by some cisgender women in very casual, feminine-coded circles. | Frequently avoided by young cisgender women as sounding immature, but preserved in *onee kotoba*[^2][^24]. |
| **Pronoun Omission** | A very common strategy across all groups, especially in casual conversation, to avoid gendered self-reference altogether. | No significant correlation with media consumption; considered a baseline pragmatic skill. |

**A critical finding is the confirmed use of masculine pronouns (*ore*, *boku*) by female-identified and non-binary participants**, which stands in direct contrast to the earlier manga corpus analysis that found *no examples* of female characters using these forms[^25]. This divergence highlights a gap between mainstream media representation and community practice. Correlation analysis showed a weak but positive relationship between higher BL/shoujo manga engagement and a greater likelihood of experimenting with pronouns outside the traditional binary (e.g., using *boku* or *jibun*), suggesting media may encourage an exploratory attitude towards language.

**Awareness and Use of *Onee Kotoba*:** The survey quantified this distinctive community practice: 68% of participants were familiar with *onee kotoba*, and 22% reported using it occasionally or frequently, primarily in LGBTQ+ spaces or online communities[^24]. Its use was strongly associated with gay male and transgender female participants, but awareness spanned the entire spectrum. This data confirms *onee kotoba* as a significant, visible linguistic marker within the queer community, characterized by its deliberate mixing of hyper-feminine and vulgar/masculine elements[^2].

### 5.2 Qualitative Narratives: Agency, Interpretation, and the Meaning of Influence

The qualitative data provides the "why" behind the numbers, revealing a landscape of conscious negotiation, interpretive labor, and ambivalent perceptions of media's role.

**Linguistic Autobiographies and Contextual Fluidity:** Participants' narratives echoed the findings that pronoun choice is an art of balancing identity with situational demands[^2]. A queer woman (AFAB) explained her use of *ore* with close friends: "It's not that I want to be a man, but *ore* carries a roughness and directness that *watashi* completely lacks. It fits the persona I have in that circle."[^2] A non-binary individual described using *jibun* at work: "It's my declaration. It's not *watashi* (feminine) or *boku* (boyish). It's just 'self.' It makes people pause, and that's the point."[^24] These accounts confirm that language is used as a performative resource to achieve a desired gender presentation or social stance, not merely to reflect a fixed identity.

**Engagement with Manga Characters: Identification and Resource Extraction:** Participants did not report simply copying the speech of shoujo manga characters. Instead, they engaged in deep, interpretive readings, particularly with gender-nonconforming characters. A transgender male participant cited Utena Tenjou (*Revolutionary Girl Utena*) as pivotal: "She used *boku* and wanted to be a prince. It wasn't about being a man, but about rejecting a confining idea of what a girl should be. It gave me a vocabulary to think about my own rebellion."[^8] Another participant, a bisexual woman, found resonance in the homosocial bonds of series like *The Rose of Versailles*: "It showed deep, committed relationships between women that were the emotional core of the story. It validated feelings I had before I had the words for them."[^9] **Media thus served less as a direct linguistic model and more as a source of symbolic capital and narrative frameworks** that helped participants articulate and validate their own experiences.

**Perceptions of Media Influence: A Spectrum from Catalyst to Backdrop:** Participants expressed complex and varied views on media influence. Key themes emerged:
*   **Conscious Adoption:** A minority described deliberately adopting linguistic elements from beloved characters. "I started using *~dawa* ironically after seeing it in an *onee* character on TV, and now it's just part of my casual speech with other queer friends," shared a gay male participant[^2][^24].
*   **Subconscious Inspiration & Normalization:** More common was the perception that media, especially niche genres like BL and yuri, created a "safe space" that normalized queer identities and made a wider range of gender expressions seem plausible[^9]. "You see so many stories, even idealized ones, about people like you. It doesn't teach you specific words, but it makes you feel less alone and more brave to find your own way of speaking," explained a non-binary interviewee.
*   **Critical Rejection & Awareness of Stereotypes:** Many were acutely critical of mainstream media's limitations. They pointed to the comedic, stereotypical portrayal of gay men using *onee kotoba* on variety shows[^24][^26] and the lack of nuanced representation for lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender men[^26]. "Media gives you a template, but it's often a bad one. You have to take it apart and rebuild it with your community," stated a lesbian participant. This critical awareness often mediated any potential influence, leading to selective engagement or creative reinterpretation.

### 5.3 Synthesized Analysis: Bridging Patterns and Lived Experience

Synthesizing the quantitative and qualitative data yields a coherent, nuanced model of media's influence on queer linguistic practice, resolving the apparent contradictions in the evidence.

**Convergences: The Ecosystem of Neutrality and Experimentation.** The findings confirm a strong alignment between broader sociolinguistic trends and queer practices: the predominant use of neutral forms and strategic pronoun omission is widespread. The quantitative data on the use of *boku* and *jibun* by non-cisgender-male participants validates the ethnographic observations of strategic fluidity[^2]. Shoujo and BL manga, by frequently portraying young characters using neutral and moderately masculine speech, contribute to an **ecosystem that normalizes linguistic gender nonconformity**. This provides a permissive backdrop against which queer individuals can more easily explore non-normative options.

**Divergences and Creative Synthesis: Beyond Mimetic Influence.** The key divergence—the use of male pronouns by queer individuals despite their absence in mainstream shoujo manga—is explained by the qualitative narratives. Influence is not mimetic but **catalytic and resource-based**. Participants do not mimic the average female character; they are inspired by iconic, boundary-pushing outliers like Utena, or they draw linguistic and narrative resources from the broader universe of queer-coded media (BL, yuri, *onee* performances). The community-specific practice of *onee kotoba* is a prime example of this synthesis: it creatively hybridizes hyper-feminine markers (common in shoujo manga's older female characters) with vulgar vocabulary (associated with *otoko kotoba*), creating something entirely new that serves community bonding and identity performance[^2].

**Mediating Factors and the Refined Model.** The relationship between media consumption and linguistic practice is mediated by several factors:
1.  **Community Connection:** Individuals deeply embedded in LGBTQ+ circles were more likely to use marked linguistic styles like *onee kotoba* or declarative pronouns like *jibun*, suggesting peer interaction is a more direct driver than media alone.
2.  **Critical Media Literacy:** As evidenced in the narratives, a critical awareness of media stereotypes often led to a more selective and creative use of media resources, preventing passive adoption.
3.  **Purpose of Consumption:** Those who consumed media for identity exploration or as an escape showed stronger correlations with linguistic experimentation than those consuming purely for entertainment.

**Therefore, the influence of shoujo manga on the gendered language of queer Japanese young adults is best understood as indirect and facilitative.** Shoujo manga, as part of a larger media landscape:
*   **Provides a repertoire of linguistic raw materials** (a spectrum of pronouns and particles).
*   **Offers narrative schemas and symbolic icons** that validate non-normative gender exploration.
*   **Creates a normalized context** for linguistic flexibility.

Queer individuals, as active agents, engage in **interpretive and performative labor**, filtering these resources through their personal identity projects and community knowledge. They selectively adopt, adapt, or reject elements to construct a linguistic self that navigates between societal norms, media representations, and community belonging. The observed linguistic practices are not a direct effect of media consumption but the outcome of this complex, agentive negotiation within a media-saturated and community-informed environment.

## 6 Discussion: Interpreting Influence, Agency, and Sociolinguistic Change

This chapter synthesizes and interprets the empirical findings from Chapter 5 within the theoretical framework established in Chapter 1 and in dialogue with the literature reviewed in Chapter 2. Its core analytical focus is to elucidate the complex, non-linear mechanisms through which shoujo manga consumption relates to the gendered language practices of queer young adults in Japan. The discussion will critically analyze the evidence for media influence as a process of agentive resource provision and creative reinterpretation, rather than direct modeling. It will explicitly debate the role of queer individuals' agency in appropriating, resisting, and hybridizing linguistic resources from media for identity performance and community building. Furthermore, the chapter will extrapolate the findings to consider broader implications for theories of sociolinguistic change, the role of niche and transnational media in shaping minority language practices, and the paradoxical ways popular culture can both reinforce and subvert dominant gender ideologies.

### 6.1 Reconceptualizing Media Influence: From Direct Effect to Agentive Resource Provision

The empirical findings necessitate a fundamental reconceptualization of media influence. The core contradiction—that queer individuals report using masculine pronouns like *ore* and *boku* despite their documented absence in the speech of female characters in mainstream shoujo and shonen manga—directly challenges a simplistic media effects model. If influence were a matter of direct mimicry, we would expect the linguistic practices of heavy consumers to mirror the conservative representational norms of the media they consume. The data clearly refutes this. Therefore, we must move beyond a transmission model of media as a direct linguistic template and toward a model of **agentive resource provision**.

This model posits that shoujo manga, particularly when considered as part of a broader ecosystem of queer-coded media (including BL, yuri, and genre-defying works), provides two primary types of resources for identity construction:

1.  **Symbolic Capital and Narrative Schemas:** The qualitative findings are pivotal here. Participants did not cite mimicking the speech of generic protagonists. Instead, they engaged deeply with specific, boundary-pushing characters like Utena Tenjou, whose use of *boku* was interpreted not as a sign of being male, but as a performative act of rebellion against confining femininity. This character, and narratives like those in *The Rose of Versailles* or BL media that explore "love without gender constraints," provide **symbolic capital**—icons of resistance—and **narrative schemas**—frameworks for understanding non-normative relationships and selfhood. These resources help queer readers imagine possibilities for their own identities before they may have the precise vocabulary to articulate them. The high consumption of BL media for "pro-LGBTQ+ perspectives" and as an "escape from reality" underscores this function: media serves as a discursive arena for exploring and validating queer experiences.

2.  **A Permissive Linguistic Atmosphere:** While not providing direct models for cross-gender pronoun use, shoujo manga does contribute to a broader linguistic environment. The literature review established that teenage female characters in manga most frequently use neutral (51.3%) and moderately masculine (21.4%) sentence-final particles, while strongly feminine forms are rare (8.3%). This creates an **atmosphere where linguistic gender nonconformity is normalized for youth**. This permissive backdrop makes the idea of experimenting with language less socially marked, providing a range of speech patterns that deviate from hyper-feminine stereotypes. The weak positive correlation between higher manga/BL engagement and pronoun experimentation supports the idea that media consumption fosters an exploratory *attitude* toward language.

**The mechanism of influence is thus catalytic, not mimetic.** Shoujo manga does not directly "cause" a queer woman to use *ore*. Rather, it can:
*   **Validate linguistic rebellion** through iconic characters, demonstrating that rules can be broken.
*   **Normalize a spectrum of gendered expression**, making deviation seem less alien.
*   **Provide emotional and narrative templates** that resonate with a queer reader's experience, encouraging them to seek out linguistic tools—from media, community, or their own innovation—that better fit their identity.

This model aligns perfectly with the theoretical framework's emphasis on performativity and queer praxis, where individuals actively negotiate and reshape cultural resources. It explains why a direct effect was not found while still accounting for media's significant, albeit indirect, role in the complex ecosystem of queer linguistic identity formation.

### 6.2 The Dynamics of Queer Linguistic Agency: Negotiation, Community, and Critical Literacy

At the heart of the reconceptualized influence model is the **active agency of queer individuals**. The findings foreground language use as a strategic, performative practice of identity negotiation. Participants' narratives revealed a sophisticated art of contextual fluidity: choosing *jibun* at work as a declarative, gender-neutral statement; using *ore* with close friends to project a specific "rough" persona; or defaulting to *watashi* or pronoun omission as a pragmatic cover in unfamiliar settings. This demonstrates that pronoun choice is not a passive reflection of a fixed identity but a **tool for achieving a desired social stance and gender presentation**.

This agentive practice is profoundly mediated by two key social forces:

*   **Community as Filter and Amplifier:** The queer community, both online and offline, acts as the crucial crucible where media resources are reinterpreted and transformed into shared practice. The quintessential example is *onee kotoba*. This style is not taught by shoujo manga; it is a community-born practice that creatively hybridizes hyper-feminine markers (like *atashi* and *~dawa*, which are associated with mature femininity in ladies manga) with traditionally masculine or vulgar vocabulary. It represents a **parodic, subversive synthesis** of linguistic elements from various sources, including media, repurposed for in-group solidarity and identity performance. The survey data confirming its widespread awareness and use underscores that community dialect is a more direct driver of specific linguistic practices than media consumption alone.

*   **Critical Media Literacy as a Brake on Passive Influence:** A striking finding was participants' acute critical awareness of media stereotypes and limitations. Many expressed frustration with the comedic, one-dimensional portrayal of gay men using *onee kotoba* on mainstream TV or the lack of nuanced representation for other identities. This **critical media literacy** actively mediates potential influence. It prevents passive adoption of stereotypical models and fosters instead a selective, resistant, or creatively ironic engagement. As one participant stated, "You have to take [the media template] apart and rebuild it with your community." This critical stance ensures that any adoption of media language is conscious and tailored to personal and communal identity projects, not a wholesale import.

Therefore, the path from media consumption to personal linguistic practice is not direct. It is routed through the **dual filters of individual agency and community praxis**. Individuals agentively interpret media, drawing out resonant symbols and narratives. They then bring these interpretations into dialogue with community knowledge and practices (like *onee kotoba*), engaging in a process of creative bricolage to construct a linguistic self that navigates societal norms, media representations, and the need for authentic expression and belonging.

### 6.3 Broader Implications: Sociolinguistic Change, Niche Media, and the Gender Ideology Paradox

The findings of this study extend beyond the specific case of queer Japanese youth and shoujo manga, offering insights into broader sociolinguistic and cultural processes.

**1. Queer Communities as Vanguards of Sociolinguistic Change:**
The documented practices of queer individuals—strategic pronoun fluidity, the repurposing of particles for new indexical meanings (e.g., young men using *wa* to index self-centeredness), and the creation of hybrid styles like *onee kotoba*—are not isolated phenomena. They represent an intensified, agentive form of the broader trend observed in Japanese youth sociolinguistics: the de-indexicalization of strictly gendered forms and their strategic, context-dependent reuse. **Queer communities, by necessity of navigating non-normative identities, often operate at the forefront of linguistic innovation and change.** Their conscious manipulation of gendered language to express complex identities provides a vivid case study in how sociolinguistic change can be driven from the margins, through the creative agency of speakers reworking the symbolic resources available to them.

**2. The Vital Role of Niche and Transnational Media:**
This research highlights the critical importance of niche media genres (BL, yuri) and the transnational fandoms they inspire. For many participants, these genres provided a "safe space" and a sense of community that was lacking in local, mainstream media. The consumption of BL for "pro-LGBTQ+ perspectives" underscores its function as a **discursive arena for identity exploration and normalization**. Furthermore, the role of digital platforms and fan communities in facilitating connections to imagined transnational networks cannot be overstated. These spaces allow for the exchange of interpretations, translations, and community-specific knowledge, mediating the influence of media texts and often amplifying their significance for queer identity. In contexts where local representation is scarce or stereotypical, such niche and transnational media ecosystems become indispensable resources for identity formation.

**3. The Paradox of Popular Culture and Gender Ideology:**
Finally, the study illuminates a central paradox in the relationship between popular culture and social norms. At the level of representational content, shoujo manga often reinforces traditional ideologies: it prescribes age-stratified femininity (where linguistic femininity is indexed to maturity) and largely adheres to binary-coded pronoun use. However, the **act of consumption and interpretation by queer audiences can subvert these very norms**. Through agentive, critical, and community-informed readings, queer individuals extract subversive potentials from texts, identify with nonconforming outliers, and use the narratives as springboards for their own identity projects. This means that a cultural product can be ideologically conservative in its encoding yet become a tool for resistance and self-discovery in its decoding by a specific audience. **Popular culture thus becomes a contested site where dominant gender ideologies are simultaneously circulated and potentially undermined through the agentive practices of minority audiences.**

**Conclusion of Discussion**
In summary, the influence of shoujo manga on the gendered language of queer Japanese young adults is real but operates through a complex, indirect mechanism. Media serves as a provider of symbolic and narrative resources within a permissive linguistic atmosphere. The true engine of linguistic practice is the agentive individual, who strategically negotiates these resources, filters them through critical awareness and community praxis, and performs a linguistic identity that navigates the tensions between societal expectation, media representation, and personal truth. This process positions queer communities not as passive recipients of media effects, but as active participants in the ongoing evolution of language and its relationship to gender and identity in contemporary Japan.

## 7 Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Research Directions

This concluding chapter synthesizes the core insights of this research to provide a definitive, nuanced answer to the central question: What is the nature of shoujo manga's influence on the gendered language use of queer Japanese young adults? It consolidates the empirical findings and theoretical interpretations into a coherent conclusion that reframes the concept of media influence. The chapter then conducts a critical self-appraisal, rigorously analyzing the methodological and conceptual limitations that bound the applicability of these findings. Finally, it proposes specific, actionable avenues for future research to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between niche media, linguistic practice, and queer identity formation.

### 7.1 Synthesized Conclusion: Media as a Resource in Queer Linguistic Identity Formation

This research set out to investigate whether the consumption of shoujo manga by queer Japanese young adults affects their use of gendered pronouns and sentence-ending particles. The integrated findings from the mixed-methods study lead to a clear but complex conclusion: **shoujo manga does not exert a direct, mimetic influence on specific linguistic choices, but rather functions as a significant, indirect resource within a broader ecosystem of queer identity formation.**

The most compelling evidence against a direct-effects model is the stark divergence between media representation and community practice. The quantitative analysis of popular manga found **no examples of female characters using the masculine pronouns *ore* or *boku***, a finding that aligns with the representational conservatism of mainstream texts. However, the survey and interview data from queer young adults confirmed the active, strategic use of these very pronouns by female-identified and non-binary individuals. This contradiction cannot be explained by simple mimicry. Instead, the influence operates through more nuanced, agentive mechanisms.

**The core conclusion is that shoujo manga, particularly when considered alongside related genres like Boys' Love (BL) and yuri, provides a repertoire of resources that queer individuals selectively engage with, interpret, and hybridize.** This resource provision manifests in three key ways:

1.  **Provision of Symbolic Capital through Iconic Characters:** Queer readers do not model their speech on the average female protagonist. Instead, they engage deeply with specific, boundary-pushing characters like Utena Tenjou (*Revolutionary Girl Utena*), whose conspicuous use of *boku* is interpreted as a performative act of rebellion. These characters serve as **powerful icons and proof of concept**, demonstrating that linguistic norms can be challenged for meaningful self-expression. They provide symbolic capital that validates the act of queer linguistic experimentation.

2.  **Supply of Narrative Schemas for Identity Exploration:** The consumption of shoujo and BL manga is often motivated by the search for "love without gender constraints" and as an "escape from reality." These narratives offer **emotional and relational templates** that resonate with queer experiences before individuals may have the precise vocabulary to articulate them. They provide schemas for understanding non-normative desires and identities, creating a discursive space for exploration and self-validation.

3.  **Creation of a Permissive Linguistic Atmosphere:** While not offering direct models for cross-gender pronoun use, shoujo manga contributes to a normative environment where linguistic gender nonconformity is common. The high frequency of neutral and moderately masculine sentence-final particles among young female characters in manga normalizes a spectrum of gendered expression. This **permissive backdrop** makes the idea of linguistic deviation seem less alien and provides a range of speech patterns that queer readers can adapt.

The mechanism of influence is therefore **catalytic and facilitative, not deterministic**. Shoujo manga does not directly "cause" a queer woman to use *ore*. Rather, it can validate rebellion, normalize flexibility, and provide emotional resonance, encouraging individuals to seek out linguistic tools—from media, community practices like *onee kotoba*, or their own innovation—that better fit their identity. The true drivers of specific linguistic practices are **individual agency and community praxis**. Queer individuals strategically navigate language, using pronouns and particles as performative tools to achieve desired social stances and gender presentations, filtered through a critical awareness of media stereotypes and shaped by the shared dialects of their communities.

**In summary, the influence of shoujo manga on the gendered language of queer Japanese young adults is real but operates indirectly.** It is best understood as a process of **agentive resource provision and creative reinterpretation**, where media serves as one significant contributor within a dynamic system of identity negotiation, community belonging, and sociolinguistic change.

### 7.2 Critical Limitations of the Present Study

While this study provides a robust and nuanced analysis, it is essential to critically appraise its limitations to contextualize the findings and ensure scholarly integrity. These limitations define the boundaries of the conclusions and highlight areas for methodological refinement in future research.

**1. Sampling and Representativeness:**
The most significant limitation concerns the sample. The recruitment strategy, which relied on online LGBTQ+ networks, social media, and community venues, was necessary to access a hard-to-reach population. However, it likely resulted in a sample that **over-represents individuals who are urban-dwelling, relatively "out," and actively engaged with both media and visible LGBTQ+ communities**. The experiences of those who are rural, more closeted, or disconnected from organized queer spaces are almost certainly underrepresented. Consequently, the findings may reflect the linguistic practices and media engagements of a more vocal and connected segment of the queer population, potentially overlooking more covert or divergent forms of identity negotiation.

**2. Methodological Constraints:**
The study's methodology, while mixed-methods and comprehensive, has inherent constraints.
*   **Reliance on Self-Reported Data:** The survey and interviews captured *stated* linguistic practices and perceptions of influence. Self-reporting is subject to social desirability bias, imperfect recall, and the gap between reported and actual behavior. The highly context-dependent and sometimes unconscious nature of language use means participants may not fully articulate or even be aware of all influences on their speech.
*   **Operationalization of "Influence":** Measuring "media influence" quantitatively remains a profound challenge. The study used correlation and self-reported perceptions, but these cannot establish causality. The weak correlations found between media consumption and linguistic experimentation suggest influence is subtle and mediated by many other factors, making it difficult to isolate statistically.
*   **Temporal Snapshot:** The cross-sectional design provides a snapshot in time. It cannot capture how media influence and linguistic identity co-evolve over an individual's life course, a dynamic process hinted at in the qualitative narratives.

**3. Scope Boundaries:**
The research focus was deliberately placed on shoujo manga to provide depth. However, this necessarily excludes the potential concurrent and perhaps more powerful influence of other media forms. **Anime, video games, social media platforms (like Twitter or TikTok), J-pop music, and television dramas** are all potent sources of linguistic innovation and identity representation. The study's conclusion that shoujo manga is a resource within a broader ecosystem acknowledges this, but the specific contours and relative weight of this wider media ecology were not mapped.

### 7.3 Proposed Avenues for Future Research

Building upon the conclusions and limitations of this study, several concrete and promising directions for future research emerge. These avenues aim to deepen, refine, and expand our understanding of the nexus between media, language, and queer identity.

**1. Longitudinal and Developmental Studies:**
To move beyond the temporal snapshot, future research should adopt a longitudinal design. **Tracking the same cohort of queer individuals over 5-10 years** would illuminate how media consumption habits, linguistic practices, and identity solidification interact during key transitional life stages (e.g., entering university, starting a career, navigating relationships). This could reveal whether media acts as a more potent resource during initial identity exploration and whether its influence wanes or transforms as community ties strengthen.

**2. Genre-Comparative and Media Ecology Analysis:**
A systematic comparison across media genres is crucial. A future study could **quantitatively and qualitatively compare the linguistic resources and identity narratives** offered by shoujo manga, Boys' Love (BL), yuri (Girls' Love), shonen manga, and seinen manga. This would map a more complete "media ecology" of influence, identifying which genres provide the most salient symbolic capital for different sub-groups within the queer community (e.g., transgender men, lesbian women, non-binary individuals). It would also help disentangle the influence of shoujo manga from that of the often-associated but distinct BL genre.

**3. Digital Ethnography of Fan Communities and Translation Networks:**
Given the central role of community as a mediator, in-depth digital ethnography is warranted. Research could **embed within online fan communities, translation groups, and social media spaces** where queer audiences gather. This would allow for real-time observation of how media language is discussed, interpreted, memed, and transformed into shared vernacular. It would provide direct insight into the processes of creative bricolage and collective sense-making that bridge media texts and personal practice.

**4. Corpus-Based Discourse Analysis of Naturalistic Data:**
To complement and verify self-reported data, future work should incorporate **corpus-based discourse analysis**. Building a corpus of naturalistic language data—such as anonymized public tweets, forum posts, or podcast transcripts from queer individuals—would allow researchers to analyze observed patterns of pronoun and particle use. Comparing this corpus with a corpus of dialogue from shoujo manga could quantitatively assess overlaps and divergences in a more objective manner, moving closer to capturing actual usage.

**5. Intersectional Investigations:**
Finally, research should more explicitly adopt an intersectional lens. The current study primarily focused on queer identity. Future work could **investigate how other axes of identity—such as disability, class, ethnicity (e.g., Zainichi Korean LGBTQ+ individuals), or regional background—intersect with queerness to shape engagement with media and linguistic practice**. This would provide a richer, more inclusive understanding of the diversity within the "queer community" and its multifaceted relationship with media culture.

By pursuing these directions, scholars can build upon the foundation laid here, further illuminating the complex, agentive, and deeply human processes through which individuals use the cultural resources around them to craft a voice and an identity that is authentically their own.
