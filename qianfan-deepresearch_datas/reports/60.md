# Architecting Situational Awareness for the Cislunar Domain: Enabling Effective Short-Term Tracking and Monitoring
## 1 The Cislunar Operational Environment: Defining the Challenge for Situational Awareness

This chapter establishes the foundational operational context for cislunar space situational awareness (CSSA) by systematically analyzing the unique physical and operational characteristics that differentiate it from traditional Earth orbital regimes. The analysis is structured around three core challenges: the vast and complex astrodynamical volume defined by multi-body gravitational dynamics, the demanding physical environment including radiation and lunar plasma effects, and the projected increase in mission traffic and object diversity. The chapter synthesizes data from reference materials to define the operational volume (extending from GEO to beyond lunar orbit, encompassing Lagrange points and periodic orbit families), detail the inherent instability and chaos of trajectories governed by the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP), and outline the growing congestion from planned missions (e.g., Artemis, Chang'e, commercial ventures). This establishes the specific, non-trivial requirements that any effective CSSA architecture must address, setting the stage for subsequent analysis of surveillance gaps and technological solutions.

### 1.1 The Vast and Dynamically Complex Volume of Cislunar Space

The cislunar domain presents a surveillance challenge of unprecedented scale and complexity, fundamentally different from the well-understood near-Earth environment. **The sheer volume is staggering: while geosynchronous orbit (GEO) lies at approximately 42,164 km from Earth, the average Earth-Moon distance is about 384,402 km, or 9.12 times farther[^1].** Transfers and operations can extend well beyond the Moon to distances exceeding 1.5 million km (over 35 GEO radii)[^1]. This expansion represents a more than tenfold increase in operational range and a **1,000-fold increase in service volume compared to operations confined within GEO**[^1].

The fundamental challenge stems from the shift in governing physics. Unlike the predictable, conic-section trajectories of classical two-body (Keplerian) motion, trajectories in cislunar space are dominated by the gravitational interplay of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) model is essential for understanding this regime[^1][^2]. In this rotating frame, five equilibrium points known as Lagrange points (L1-L5) exist, where an object can remain stationary relative to the Earth-Moon system[^1]. **Beyond these points, there exist infinite families of repeating natural orbits (periodic orbits), such as L1/L2 Halo orbits, Lyapunov orbits, and Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs)**, which repeat their path in the rotating frame with periods ranging from days to over a month[^1]. NASA's Lunar Gateway is planned for a specific type of halo orbit known as a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO)[^1].

A critical consequence of this three-body dynamics is widespread instability and chaos. **Most trajectories, including those through L1, L2, L3 and most periodic orbits, are unstable, meaning objects will drift away exponentially from their nominal path with even minute perturbations**[^1]. The sole exceptions are small, stable regions around the L4 and L5 points[^1]. This chaotic sensitivity means that small errors in an object's measured state (position/velocity) can lead to enormous differences in its predicted future position, making long-term prediction highly unreliable. Consequently, the traditional Two-Line Element (TLE) sets used for cataloging near-Earth objects are **completely inadequate for cislunar space due to a lack of numerical precision and the rapid divergence of trajectories**[^1]. The established best practice is to share precise, instantaneous position and velocity vectors in an agreed-upon inertial reference frame[^1].

The table below summarizes the key astrodynamical contrasts between the traditional near-Earth and cislunar regimes:

| Characteristic | Near-Earth Regime (e.g., LEO, GEO) | Cislunar Regime |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dominant Dynamics** | Primarily two-body (Earth-centric) Keplerian motion. | Three-body and four-body dynamics (Earth-Moon-Sun). |
| **Trajectory Geometry** | Primarily circular, elliptical, and planar. | Non-circular, non-elliptical, often non-planar, and mostly non-repeating. |
| **Stability** | Generally stable over long periods (excluding atmospheric drag in LEO). | Inherently unstable and chaotic for most orbits; small deviations cause large future errors. |
| **Cataloging Method** | Effective use of Two-Line Elements (TLEs). | TLEs are not useful; requires sharing of precise epoch state vectors. |
| **Key Orbital Features** | Orbital planes, eccentricity, altitude. | Lagrange points (L1-L5), periodic orbit families (Halo, Lyapunov, DRO), unstable/stable manifolds. |

### 1.2 The Hostile Physical Environment and Its Observational Impacts

Beyond gravitational complexity, the cislunar environment presents a suite of physical challenges that degrade sensor performance and complicate spacecraft operations, creating persistent gaps in surveillance coverage.

**Extreme Distance and Sensor Limits:** The vast ranges are the most direct impediment to detection. Objects are significantly fainter and their angular motion is slower, pushing ground- and space-based sensors to their sensitivity limits[^1][^2]. For example, a simulation showed that a large satellite in an Earth-Moon L2 halo orbit would have a visual magnitude ranging from 15 to 22-23, visible to ground-based networks for only about 6 days per month. A smaller satellite could have magnitudes from 20 to 26, making it **never visible to current major ground-based optical sensors**[^3][^4].

**Problematic Illumination and Exclusion Zones:** Observation geometry is severely constrained by celestial bodies. The Moon creates a major source of background noise; observations close to the lunar disk are frequently saturated by stray light, creating effective "exclusion zones"[^2][^5]. Similarly, solar exclusion angles must be respected to protect sensors. Furthermore, targets may enter extended periods of darkness or present unfavorable solar phase angles (the angle between the Sun, target, and observer), making them optically faint or invisible, as demonstrated during the Chang'e 5 return mission[^3]. The Earth's albedo (reflected light) and its atmosphere also introduce variable perturbations on spacecraft motion, especially for objects with low perigees[^6].

**The Cislunar Plasma Environment:** The Moon possesses a tenuous exosphere and associated plasma environment. Research from the Luna-19 and Luna-22 missions indicates a **thin layer of plasma exists above the sunlit lunar surface, with maximum electron concentrations on the order of 10³ per cm³**, likely formed from ionized heavy gases like argon and shaped by local lunar magnetic fields[^7]. Future human activity poses a potential environmental impact: simulations suggest that while occasional landings (like Artemis) may only marginally increase the native ion production rate, sustained and frequent operations or human settlement could inject enough neutral gas to increase ionization rates by 100 to 1000 times the native level[^8]. **This could trigger significant mass-loading of the solar wind, fundamentally altering the plasma environment around the Moon** and potentially affecting spacecraft operations and sensor readings[^8].

**Operational Challenges from Instability:** The dynamical instability discussed earlier has direct operational ramifications. Spacecraft in unstable orbits like NRHOs require **frequent, small station-keeping maneuvers (often in the mm/s range)**, potentially needed daily or every few days[^1]. This drives a need for autonomy and complicates tracking, as it becomes challenging to distinguish the effects of these tiny intentional maneuvers from natural perturbations or other unplanned maneuvers[^1].

### 1.3 Projected Mission Traffic and the Evolving Operational Landscape

The strategic and economic value of cislunar space is driving an unprecedented surge in missions, directly creating the congestion and risk that necessitate robust situational awareness. **Over the next decade, more than 100 lunar missions are anticipated**, with over 30 missions already slated between 2024 and 2030[^9][^10][^11]. This traffic encompasses a diverse and growing portfolio of object types:

| Object/Mission Type | Examples from Reference Materials |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Crewed Spacecraft** | NASA's Orion spacecraft (Artemis program)[^12]. |
| **Lunar Orbiters & Landers** | Chang'e series (China), Luna-25 (Russia), CAPSTONE, numerous commercial landers[^9][^3][^5]. |
| **Orbital Infrastructure** | Lunar Gateway (NASA-led international station in NRHO)[^1][^13]. |
| **Servicing/Sensor Platforms** | Cislunar Highway Patrol System (CHPS - AFRL experiment)[^1], reconfigurable sensor constellations (e.g., RCAT-CS)[^12]. |
| **Navigation Constellations** | Cislunar Space Navigation System (CSNS) concept using Special Long-Period Orbits (SLPO)[^14]. |
| **Debris** | Spent rocket bodies (e.g., Chang'e Zheng-8, Luna-25 Fregat)[^5]. |

This influx leads to tangible risks. Research indicates that even with only tens of satellites in low lunar orbit (LLO), the number of close approaches is higher than expected due to operators favoring a limited set of "favorable" orbits, such as frozen orbits[^10]. **Congestion hotspots are predicted near the lunar equator (where common orbital planes intersect) and around the Lagrange points**[^10]. A Georgia Tech study, the first of its kind to model cislunar collision risk, suggests that **a fleet of 50 satellites in LLO could require up to four collision avoidance maneuvers per satellite per year**[^10]. These maneuvers are costly in terms of fuel and mission disruption, and operators often feel compelled to execute them even for extremely low-probability events (e.g., 1 in 10 million)[^10].

The combination of chaotic dynamics, a sensor-hostile environment, and rapidly increasing traffic creates a perfect storm for tracking challenges. Objects can be lost after maneuvers or due to observational gaps, and the lack of coordination in orbit selection amplifies collision risks. **This evolving landscape definitively establishes that comprehensive and accurate situational awareness is not merely an academic exercise but an urgent operational prerequisite for safe and sustainable cislunar operations.**

## 2 Requirements for Comprehensive and Accurate Cislunar Situational Awareness

This chapter translates the unique operational challenges of the cislunar domain, established in the previous chapter, into a concrete set of functional and performance requirements for a Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (CSSA) system. It defines the dual pillars of 'comprehensiveness' and 'accuracy' by analyzing mission-driven needs for safety, security, and operational efficiency. The chapter synthesizes data from reference materials to specify requirements for spatial coverage (including high-risk volumes like Lagrange points and transit corridors), detection sensitivity (targeting objects from large satellites to small debris), and catalog completeness. It further quantifies accuracy needs for orbit determination (position/velocity uncertainty), object characterization (maneuver detection, physical properties), and intent analysis, with a specific focus on the timelines and data formats necessary to support short-term decision-making for conjunction assessment and space traffic management. This chapter serves as the critical bridge between the problem definition and the subsequent evaluation of architectural solutions.

### 2.1 Defining Comprehensiveness: Coverage, Sensitivity, and Catalog Integrity

Comprehensiveness for CSSA is a multi-dimensional requirement encompassing the ability to observe the entire operational volume, detect objects across a wide range of sizes and brightness, and maintain a unified, persistent record of all resident space objects (RSOs). This is fundamentally challenged by the vast scale and dynamical complexity of cislunar space.

**Spatial Coverage and Volume Definition:** The cislunar volume is not uniformly critical. Requirements must prioritize coverage based on threat models and operational utility. Analyses define key sub-volumes that a CSSA architecture must routinely monitor. **A primary coverage volume is often composed of two critical regions: 1) an Earth-centered hollow sphere extending from Geostationary Orbit (GEO) out to 3.4 times the GEO radius (~143,000 km), and 2) the Earth-Moon transit corridor, defined along a five-day transfer trajectory and extending 10,000 km beyond the L2 Lagrange point**[^15]. This corridor captures the high-traffic zone for missions traveling to and from the Moon. Furthermore, specific orbit families, such as those around the collinear Lagrange points (L1, L2) where infrastructure like the Lunar Gateway will reside, represent high-value, high-risk volumes that demand persistent observation[^16].

**Detection Sensitivity and Limiting Magnitude:** The extreme distances in cislunar space make objects exceedingly faint. Requirements must specify the minimum detectable object size or brightness. For example, a large communications satellite in an L2 halo orbit can have a visual magnitude ranging from 15 to 23 over a lunar month, while a smaller satellite can vary from magnitude 20 to 26[^3]. Current ground-based sensors like the GEODSS network have a sensitivity limit around magnitude 18, meaning **smaller satellites may never be visible from Earth, creating a fundamental detection gap**[^3]. To achieve true comprehensiveness, CSSA systems must target significantly higher sensitivities. Dedicated programs aim for the capability to **detect objects as faint as magnitude 23 at distances up to 2 Gigameters (Gm)**, which corresponds to detecting a 1-meter object at 2 Gm or a 0.1-meter object at 0.2 Gm[^17]. This level of sensitivity is essential for detecting small debris, cubesats, or potentially non-cooperative objects.

**Catalog Integrity and Data Fusion:** A comprehensive catalog is more than a list; it is an integrated, dynamic knowledge base. The traditional Two-Line Element (TLE) format is **completely inadequate for cislunar objects due to its lack of precision and inability to represent chaotic, non-Keplerian trajectories**[^1][^18]. The requirement is to adopt high-fidelity ephemeris formats like SPICE or the CCSDS Orbit Data Message (ODM)/Orbit Comprehensive Message (OCM) for sharing object states[^18][^19]. Furthermore, catalog integrity demands the **integration of data from diverse sources, including U.S. government agencies (DoD, NASA), commercial operators, and international partners**, to develop a unified picture[^20]. This is a key action item in the National Cislunar S&T Action Plan (Action 3.4.1)[^20]. The catalog must also be resilient to observational gaps caused by the chaotic dynamics; once custody of a non-maneuvering object is lost, its predicted trajectory can diverge substantially, requiring the catalog to bound possible regions of space rather than maintain a precise single track[^1].

### 2.2 Quantifying Accuracy: Orbit Determination, Characterization, and Timeliness

Accuracy in CSSA is not a single metric but a suite of performance thresholds that directly enable mission safety and effective space traffic management. These thresholds are derived from the need to perform precise conjunction assessments and understand object behavior.

**Orbit Determination (OD) Accuracy:** The required position and velocity uncertainty varies based on the object's orbit and the application (e.g., routine tracking vs. collision avoidance). Simulation studies provide benchmarks:
* For a target in a distant L2 halo orbit observed from a space-based sensor in a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), achievable 3-sigma uncertainties are on the order of **1-2 km in position and less than 1 cm/s in velocity** for short data arcs[^3].
* With a more favorable observer-target geometry (e.g., both in L2 halo orbits), position uncertainty can improve to **400-500 meters**[^3].
* For objects in lunar orbits (e.g., frozen orbits), accuracies of **less than 1 km in position and 2 cm/s in velocity** are achievable under modified observation constraints[^3].
* Passive RF tracking with a global long-baseline network can theoretically achieve **position accuracies around 115 meters** for objects like the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter[^21].

**These OD accuracy requirements are directly linked to collision avoidance (COLA) maneuver sizing.** Research shows that the required ΔV for a COLA maneuver is linearly related to the position uncertainty of the debris object and inversely related to the time before the predicted conjunction[^22]. For example, a maneuver performed 100,000 km from Earth requires a larger ΔV if the debris tracking uncertainty is high. Therefore, **improving OD accuracy directly reduces the fuel burden and operational disruption of necessary avoidance maneuvers**[^22].

**Object Characterization: Maneuver Detection and Classification:** A key aspect of accuracy is discerning an object's intent and capabilities through its maneuvers. Cislunar spacecraft frequently execute small station-keeping maneuvers (often in the mm/s range) to maintain unstable orbits, which are difficult to distinguish from natural perturbations[^1][^18]. For more significant maneuvers, analysis shows that **impulsive maneuvers greater than approximately 1 m/s can be detected and characterized with near 100% accuracy using advanced filtering techniques like the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)**[^23]. The requirement extends to not just detecting a maneuver but classifying its direction (radial, in-track, cross-track), which is most consistently achieved for cross-track maneuvers[^23]. This capability is critical for threat assessment, understanding mission phases, and maintaining custody after an object changes its trajectory.

**Timeliness for Short-Term Decision Cycles:** "Accuracy" is meaningless if delivered too late. The operational workflow for cislunar SSA necessitates a paradigm shift from the Earth-orbit model of on-demand ephemeris generation (using distributed models like TLEs) to a system where **a central originator maintains high-fidelity states and distributes timely ephemerides**[^18]. Data timeliness requirements can expand to hours for cislunar SDA, with the primary consideration being an object's potential maneuverability[^15]. For conjunction assessment, the ability to perform timely screenings is driven by the need to allow for effective mitigation; less warning time requires a larger, more disruptive avoidance maneuver[^22]. Therefore, the CSSA system must support **rapid sensor tasking, data processing, and dissemination loops to provide actionable knowledge within tactical decision windows**, which may be as short as a few hours for monitoring new launches or anomalous behavior.

### 2.3 Mission-Driven Functional Requirements and Supporting Enablers

High-level CSSA objectives must be decomposed into specific functional capabilities tailored to support diverse cislunar missions, from NASA's Artemis campaign to commercial lunar landers. The U.S. National Cislunar Science & Technology Action Plan provides a structured framework for these requirements, outlining key actions across several domains[^20].

The table below maps strategic actions to core CSSA functional requirements and their associated technological enablers:

| Strategic Action (from National Plan) | Derived Functional Requirement | Key Enabling Technologies / Needs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1.1 / 3.2.2: Identify R&D gaps & study novel orbits**[^20] | Capability to model and optimize sensor placement in complex three-body orbits (e.g., resonant orbits, L1/L2 halos) for maximum coverage. | Advanced astrodynamics models (CR3BP), heuristic optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms), autonomous mission design tools[^15][^16]. |
| **3.2.1: Assess/upgrade existing sensors**[^20] | Ability to integrate and task hybrid networks of legacy (ground-based) and new (space-based) sensors. | Sensor fusion algorithms, collaborative constellation management software, advanced post-processing (e.g., machine learning for low SNR)[^18][^15]. |
| **3.3.1 / 3.5.1: Standardize data format & develop sharing procedures**[^20] | Secure, interoperable exchange of ephemeris, maneuver plans, and conjunction data among all operators. | Adoption of CCSDS ODM/OCM/TDM standards, implementation of delay-tolerant networking (DTN) with secure Bundle Protocol (BPv7/BPSec)[^19][^18]. |
| **3.4.1: Develop integrated object catalog**[^20] | A unified catalog that ingests and correlates data from government, commercial, and international sources, maintaining custody through chaotic dynamics. | New orbit determination algorithms for chaotic systems, reachability manifold calculations, cislunar computing resources (radiation-hardened hardware)[^18][^24]. |
| **3.1.4: Advance lunar mapping for surface safety**[^20] | Extension of SSA to lunar surface operations, providing terrain-relative positioning and hazard awareness for rovers/landers. | High-resolution lunar mapping, surface-relative navigation algorithms, communication relay networks (e.g., LunaNet)[^25]. |
| *(Implied by mission safety needs)* | Real-time or near-real-time maneuver detection and anomaly identification. | Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filters, low-thrust propulsion modeling, passive RF measurement processing[^23][^21]. |

**Supporting Infrastructure Enablers:** Beyond specific functions, achieving comprehensive and accurate CSSA depends on foundational infrastructure:
* **Autonomous & Collaborative Sensor Networks:** To overcome exclusion zones and limited coverage from any single sensor, **constellations must be capable of autonomous tasking and collaboration**, optimizing collects across the network without constant ground intervention[^18][^15].
* **Cislunar Computing Resources:** The complex algorithms for orbit determination, sensor scheduling, and data fusion require significant processing power. **Radiation-hardened, capable computing hardware must be deployed in or able to service the cislunar environment**, as terrestrial-grade systems are unsuitable[^18].
* **Visualization and Decision Support:** The complex, time-varying cislunar environment demands **intuitive visualization utilities** to present the operational picture clearly for human decision-makers, integrating timelines, spatial maps, and uncertainty representations[^18][^25].

In summary, the requirements for CSSA are stringent and multifaceted. They demand a system that can see faint objects across a million-kilometer-scale volume, track them with kilometer-to-meter-level precision despite chaotic dynamics, discern their actions in near-real-time, and share this understanding seamlessly across a diverse user community. These requirements form the essential criteria against which all sensor architectures and processing solutions must be evaluated.

## 3 Sensor and Data Collection Architectures for Cislunar Surveillance

This chapter conducts a systematic, data-driven analysis of sensor modalities and network architectures for cislunar surveillance, directly addressing the stringent requirements for comprehensiveness and accuracy established in the previous chapter. It evaluates the capabilities, limitations, and optimal placement strategies for ground-based optical, space-based optical, and lunar surface-based sensors, synthesizing insights from simulation studies and performance analyses in the reference materials. The analysis focuses on quantifying coverage gaps, detection sensitivity for small objects, and the ability to support rapid, adaptive tasking for time-sensitive monitoring. This chapter serves as the critical bridge between system requirements and concrete technological solutions, laying the groundwork for evaluating architectural trade-offs and proposing an integrated, multi-layered surveillance network.

### 3.1 Ground-Based Sensor Capabilities and Fundamental Limitations

Ground-based optical sensors represent the most mature and accessible component of any space surveillance network. However, their application to the cislunar domain is fundamentally constrained by physics, establishing a clear performance envelope beyond which space-based augmentation becomes essential.

**Sensitivity Limits and Detection Gaps:** The core challenge is the inverse-square law decay of signal strength with distance. For cislunar objects, which are roughly an order of magnitude farther than Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) objects, this results in significantly fainter apparent magnitudes[^5]. The sensitivity of a telescope is quantified by its limiting magnitude—the faintest object it can detect for a given signal-to-noise ratio and exposure time. Studies of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) 1-meter telescope determined its apparent limiting magnitude in the R-band to be approximately 18.2 (with an SNR of 5 and a 30-second exposure)[^26][^27]. Stacking images to achieve a 300-second effective exposure pushed this limit to R = 19.4[^27]. The Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) network has a similar sensitivity limit around magnitude 18[^4]. **These thresholds create a fundamental detection gap: smaller cislunar satellites, which can have visual magnitudes ranging from 20 to 26, are simply undetectable from Earth with current major optical assets**[^4]. For example, simulation of a small satellite in an Earth-Moon L2 halo orbit showed it would never be visible to the Space Surveillance Network (SSN)[^4].

**Algorithmic Extensions for Known Objects:** Despite these limits, advanced image processing algorithms can extend the utility of existing ground-based telescopes for tracking *known* cislunar objects. A motion hypothesis detection algorithm, originally developed for asteroid detection, has been successfully applied to cislunar spacecraft imagery[^5]. The algorithm shifts and combines consecutive images at differing pixel velocities to increase the signal of moving targets. It has been tested on datasets from small-aperture telescopes like the 0.27-meter Pine Park Observatory (PPO) and the USAFA Falcon Telescope Network (FTN), successfully detecting targets including the Queqiao-2 satellite, the Orion spacecraft, the Lucy probe, and the Luna-25 Fregat rocket body[^5]. **This demonstrates that with specialized processing, modest ground-based assets can contribute to custody maintenance of cooperative or previously cataloged objects, provided their brightness and motion are within the sensor's enhanced detection range.**

**Persistent Observational Constraints:** Beyond raw sensitivity, ground-based observations are severely hampered by geometric and environmental factors:
*   **Exclusion Zones:** To avoid sensor damage or saturation, observations cannot be made too close to bright objects. Typical exclusion angles are 30° for the Earth, 35° for the Moon, and 50° for the Sun[^28]. The Moon, in particular, creates a large "blind spot" or "cone of shame" in the sky for Earth-based observers[^29].
*   **Solar Phase Angle:** The brightness of a passive object depends heavily on its solar phase angle (the angle Sun-Target-Observer). Unfavorable angles can render an object optically faint even if it is within range and not occulted[^4].
*   **Limited Viewing Geometry:** All observations originate from a small region (the Earth's surface or near vicinity), providing poor geometric diversity for precise orbit determination of distant objects. This leads to long, narrow uncertainty ellipsoids.

**In summary, ground-based sensors are valuable for specific tasks, such as tracking bright objects or known targets with advanced algorithms, but their inherent physical limitations make them insufficient for the comprehensive detection and accurate tracking required for cislunar space situational awareness.** They cannot close the gap on small/debris objects and are plagued by periodic coverage losses due to celestial mechanics.

### 3.2 Space-Based and In-Situ Sensor Architectures: Design and Performance

To overcome the limitations of ground-based systems, sensor assets must be deployed within or closer to the cislunar domain. This section analyzes optimized orbital constellations, adaptive tasking frameworks, and emerging in-situ sensor concepts.

**Optimized Orbital Sensor Constellations:** Placing sensors in cislunar orbits dramatically improves detection capability by reducing range and mitigating exclusion zone impacts. Simulation studies provide quantitative performance comparisons for different constellation designs[^28][^30].

The following table synthesizes key performance metrics for various sensor network configurations from the reference materials:

| Sensor Network Type | Key Performance Metrics (for lunar-centered grid) | Observations on Specific Orbits (e.g., NRHO) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Earth-Based (e.g., GEO sat, ground station)** | ~30% of grid points observable; avg. observable time fraction ~10%; avg. apparent magnitude ~20.5 (below typical limit of 18)[^28]. | Severely limited; not primary solution for cislunar tracking. |
| **Lunar Surface Network (e.g., 6 stations)** | Greatly improved visibility over Earth-based; avg. number of observers per grid point ~1.21 (low redundancy)[^28]. | For an NRHO object, mean available observers varied between 1.6 and 2.2 over its orbit[^28]. |
| **3-Satellite Orbital Network (DRO/Lyapunov)** | Mean observable time fraction: **92.95%**; Mean available observers: **1.97**; Efficiency (observers/sensor): **0.657**[^28]. | Observable time >50% for most of orbit; difficulty near periapsis; avg. **2.23** available observers for NRHO object[^28]. |
| **5-Satellite Orbital Network (all DRO)** | Mean observable time fraction: 87.58%; suffers periodic dips due to phasing[^28]. | Not specifically reported for NRHO. |
| **7-Satellite Orbital Network (DRO/Halo/Lyapunov)** | Mean observable time fraction: **94.53%**; Mean available observers: **3.87**; High redundancy[^28]. | Not specifically reported for NRHO. |
| **Scalable SDA Constellation (QuantumNet tool)** | **Moon-centered sphere (200,000 km radius):** 99.9% coverage with 5 sats (0.3m aperture); 100% with 9 sats (0.5m aperture)[^30]. <br> **Earth-Moon corridor:** >90% coverage requires 0.6-0.8m apertures & ≥7 sats; 0.3-0.5m apertures require 15+ sats[^30]. | Tool enables trade-space exploration between aperture size, number of satellites, and coverage metrics for any defined volume. |

**Key insights from these simulations are: 1) Even small orbital networks (3-7 satellites) can achieve >90% time-based coverage of the cislunar volume, a dramatic improvement over Earth-based systems. 2) There is a clear trade-off between the number of satellites and their individual aperture size to achieve a given coverage level. 3) Orbits like Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs) and Lyapunov/Halo orbits around Lagrange points (L1/L2) are geometrically favored for providing persistent coverage**[^28][^30].

**Adaptive Tasking for Non-Cooperative Targets:** Detecting objects is only the first step; maintaining custody, especially of non-cooperative or maneuvering targets, requires intelligent sensor management. The **Interoperable Cislunar Observation Network (ICON) architecture** addresses this by framing the multi-sensor scheduling problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (sMDP)[^31]. This framework enables the generation of locally optimal sensor tasking strategies over a finite planning horizon. The process involves:
1.  **Localized Search:** Upon receiving a tracking tip (an initial state estimate with uncertainty), a sensor's search volume is discretized into a grid of azimuth-elevation cells. The sensor then performs a raster scan over this uncertainty region[^31].
2.  **Collaborative Tracking:** Once detected, the object's track is propagated. As it transits the cislunar corridor, the availability of other sensors in the network is assessed autonomously to maintain custody. A custom reward function, considering sensor position, capabilities, and occlusions, guides the tasking[^31].
3.  **Event-Driven Adjustment:** The policy dynamically adjusts based on events like exceeding maximum search time, receiving updated state information from other sensors, or encountering observation association confusion[^31].

In a simulated 48-hour scenario tracking a target transiting from LEO to the Moon, a network of six space-based sensors using this adaptive tasking scheduled **145 observations**, with different sensors (e.g., one in a Distant Retrograde Orbit making 115 observations) contributing based on their geometric advantage[^31]. **This demonstrates the critical need for autonomy and collaborative scheduling to optimize limited sensor resources and minimize tracking uncertainty in real-time.**

**In-Situ Sensors: Lunar Surface and Specialized Payloads:** Deploying sensors on the lunar surface offers unique advantages for monitoring low lunar orbit (LLO). Astrobotic's **Clavius-S** sensor is a visible-band imager designed for integration into lunar landers and surface power nodes (LunaGrid)[^32]. **Its surface-based position provides proximity to overhead LLO targets and an orientation that minimizes glare from reflected lunar light, enabling clearer observations than sensors looking across or from within the orbital plane**[^32]. It uses hardware-accelerated computer vision for real-time detection, aiming to track objects over 1,000 km above the Moon[^32].

For broader lunar domain awareness, a multi-sensor payload suite has been proposed, combining a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), a Multi-Spectral Telescope (MST), and a Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) sensor on a lower lunar orbiter (~100 km), paired with a precision navigation solution on a higher orbiter[^33]. The GPR (S-band/L-band/UHF) can profile subsurface features and resources, the MST provides detailed surface characterization, and the WFOV aids in navigation[^33]. The navigation software uses the Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) method, leveraging the asymmetric cislunar gravity field to determine absolute states via relative ranging, potentially achieving accuracies of 10 meters for a low lunar orbiter[^33]. **This concept extends situational awareness beyond orbital objects to include the lunar surface and subsurface, supporting future exploration and resource utilization.**

### 3.3 Architectural Synthesis: Hybrid Networks and Coverage Gap Analysis

A truly comprehensive cislunar surveillance capability cannot rely on a single sensor type or location. It requires a **hybrid, multi-layered architecture** that strategically combines ground-based, space-based orbital, and lunar surface-based assets to mitigate individual limitations and cover critical volumes.

**Mapping Sensors to Coverage Requirements:** The different sensor modalities naturally address different aspects of the cislunar surveillance problem:
*   **Ground-Based Optical Networks:** Best suited for **wide-area surveillance of the Earth-Moon approach corridor** and tracking of bright, cooperative objects. They provide a foundational, persistent watch but cannot peer into the lunar exclusion zone or reliably track small objects near the Moon.
*   **Cislunar Orbital Constellations:** Essential for **persistent coverage of high-value volumes** such as the Lagrange point regions (L1/L2), Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs), and the space surrounding the Moon. They solve the range and exclusion zone problems inherent to ground systems. Networks of 5-9 satellites with moderate apertures (0.3-0.5m) can provide near-continuous coverage of a Moon-centered sphere[^30].
*   **Lunar Surface-Based Sensors:** Optimized for **high-cadence monitoring of Low Lunar Orbit (LLO)**, a likely congestion hotspot. They offer a stable platform with a favorable viewing geometry for objects passing overhead[^32].
*   **Multi-Sensor Lunar Orbiters:** Provide **detailed lunar domain awareness**, including surface mapping, resource prospecting, and support for surface navigation, which is a critical enabler for sustained lunar operations[^33].

**Identifying and Mitigating Persistent Gaps:** Even with a hybrid architecture, coverage gaps exist and must be managed. Key gaps identified in simulations include:
1.  **The Lunar Exclusion Zone ("Cone of Shame"):** The region of space where Earth- or Sun-orbiting sensors have their line-of-sight blocked or degraded by the Moon itself[^29]. **Mitigation requires sensors placed in orbits that can look "around" the Moon, such as resonant Lyapunov or Halo orbits at L1 or L2.** Optimization studies for covering this static demand favor observers on 1:1 resonant L1 Lyapunov orbits in leading/trailing formations[^29].
2.  **Orbit-Specific Blind Spots:** For example, an object in a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) is difficult to observe near its periapsis (closest approach to the Moon) due to proximity and potential sensor "white out"[^28]. **Mitigation requires sensor redundancy so that when one sensor is blinded, another from a different vantage point can maintain custody.**
3.  **Phasing-Related Dips:** Certain constellation configurations, like a five-satellite network all in DROs, can experience periodic multi-day dips in coverage due to the specific phasing of the satellites[^28]. **Mitigation involves careful constellation design optimization to avoid such resonances or incorporating hybrid orbits.**

**Optimization Frameworks for Dynamic Architectures:** Designing and tasking these complex networks requires advanced optimization tools. Two prominent approaches from the references are:
*   **Time-Expanded p-Median Problem (TE-p-MP):** This mixed-integer linear programming formulation simultaneously solves constellation design (placing *p* observers into orbital slots) and sensor-tasking (assigning pointing directions over time) to maximize coverage of static or dynamic targets[^29]. It enables rapid exploration of the architecture trade-space.
*   **Concurrent Optimization of Satellite Phasing and Tasking:** This two-level optimization scheme addresses the challenge of where to place sensors in their orbits (phasing) and how to point them[^34]. The "outer loop" optimizes initial satellite phases, while the "inner loop" solves for the optimal sensor pointing schedule using integer linear programming. This approach can maximize total information gain or ensure equitable coverage across multiple targets (a "maxmin" objective)[^34].

**Conclusion: Characteristics of a Scalable Architecture**
A surveillance architecture capable of supporting effective short-term tracking and monitoring in cislunar space must exhibit the following characteristics, derived from the integrated analysis:
1.  **Hybrid and Layered:** It must integrate ground, cislunar orbital, and lunar surface sensors into a cohesive network.
2.  **Optimized for Key Volumes:** Constellation design must prioritize coverage of defined high-risk/high-traffic volumes like Lagrange regions, transit corridors, and LLO.
3.  **Adaptive and Collaborative:** Sensor tasking must be driven by autonomous, event-driven frameworks (like sMDP) that enable real-time response to maneuvering targets and optimize resource use across the network.
4.  **Scalable:** The architecture should allow for incremental growth, where adding sensors or upgrading apertures predictably improves coverage metrics, as demonstrated by tools like QuantumNet[^30].
5.  **Resilient to Gaps:** It must acknowledge and strategically mitigate inherent coverage gaps through redundancy, diverse orbital placements, and dynamic tasking.

This multi-faceted sensor architecture forms the essential data-collection foundation upon which advanced data fusion, processing, and command/control systems—topics of subsequent chapters—must be built to deliver actionable situational awareness.

## 4 Data Fusion, Processing, and Characterization in a Data-Denied Environment

This chapter analyzes the core data processing and fusion methodologies required to convert sparse, heterogeneous sensor observations from distributed cislunar assets into a reliable, actionable common operational picture for short-term tracking and monitoring. Building upon the sensor architectures from Chapter 3, it focuses on overcoming the specific challenges of chaotic multi-body dynamics, long observational gaps, and the need for rapid decision-making. The analysis is structured around three key areas: 1) advanced initial and precise orbit determination algorithms tailored for non-Keplerian regimes, 2) robust multi-target tracking and maneuver detection techniques for non-cooperative objects, and 3) object characterization and change detection methods using limited data. The chapter synthesizes insights from reference materials to evaluate the performance, computational efficiency, and applicability of techniques such as collocation-based IOD, adaptive Gaussian mixture filters, and photometric analysis, establishing the essential algorithmic backbone for a responsive Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (CSSA) system.

### 4.1 Advanced Orbit Determination in Chaotic Multi-Body Regimes

The fundamental shift from predictable two-body dynamics to chaotic three-body regimes renders classical orbit determination methods obsolete for cislunar space. The traditional paradigm of distributing state data in Two-Line Element (TLE) format is invalid, as TLEs are based on two-body dynamics and cannot represent the complex, sensitive trajectories of the cislunar domain[^18]. A new paradigm is recommended where a central originator maintains high-fidelity states and distributes precise ephemerides using formats like SPICE[^18]. This subchapter examines three advanced algorithmic approaches designed to meet this challenge, enabling the establishment and maintenance of custody from sparse, chance detections.

**1. Probabilistic Initialization with Passive RF Fusion**
For scenarios with extremely limited data—such as a single detection or short observational arc—the Probabilistic Admissible Region (PAR) technique provides a foundational capability. It uses a single electro-optical astrometric observation to probabilistically initialize an uncertain trajectory, generating a non-Gaussian, multi-modal particle cloud of possible orbits[^35]. This particle cloud is then refined using the Particle Gaussian Mixture Filter (PGMF), which combines particle filtering for nonlinear propagation with an analytical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) update for computational tractability[^35]. **A significant advancement is the extension of this framework to incorporate passive radio frequency (RF) observations, such as Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) from multiple ground stations and One-Way Doppler (OWD) measurements**[^35]. This fusion is critical in a data-denied environment, as RF data provides complementary information to optical tracks. Simulation results show that while TDOA-only or OWD-only tracking has limitations, fusing RF with electro-optical data yields the best performance, with one study achieving position errors around 0.1% and velocity errors around 0.15% after 16 hours of tracking a lunar resonant orbit[^35].

**2. Machine Learning-Infused Initial Orbit Determination**
To directly address the failure of classical two-body IOD methods (e.g., Gooding's algorithm) in cislunar space, the Machine Classifier for Cislunar Orbit Determination (MCCLOD) model employs neural networks infused with knowledge of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP) dynamics[^36]. Trained on datasets from periodic orbit families (e.g., Earth-Moon L1 and L2 halo orbits), MCCLOD maps sparse angles-only measurements to a low-dimensional parameter space (η, τ) that describes a unique state on a known orbit family. **This approach demonstrates a drastic improvement, achieving position errors up to two orders of magnitude lower than the traditional Gooding method in test scenarios**[^36]. For instance, in tracking a northern L2 halo trajectory, MCCLOD delivered states within 2000 km of the truth, while Gooding's error was over 56,000 km for the same observational pass[^36]. A hybrid method—using a combined classification-regression model to identify the orbit family, then a regression-only model for that family to estimate the state—proves effective even without prior knowledge of the correct orbit family[^36].

**3. Robust, Large-Convergence Algorithms via Direct Collocation**
Perhaps the most robust solution for handling long observation gaps and chaotic dynamics is the Universal Angles-Only IOD algorithm using sparse grid collocation methods[^37][^38]. Unlike traditional "shooting" methods that use explicit numerical integration and are highly sensitive to initial guesses, the collocation approach discretizes the solution space over time nodes. It replaces continuous-time dynamics with algebraic constraints, formulating the problem as a large-scale sparse Nonlinear Programming Problem (NLP) solvable by efficient solvers like IPOPT[^37]. **This method requires minimal *a priori* knowledge, can converge from wide initial guesses (e.g., initializing at a Lagrange point), and is uniquely stable over observation gaps spanning days or even weeks**[^37][^38]. Case studies demonstrate its effectiveness for diverse orbits like L2 Southern Halo, Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs), and long-period orbits, achieving position errors generally below 50 km and velocity errors below 10 cm/s with realistic measurement noise[^37]. An extension of this method can even simultaneously estimate a naturally repeating orbit and its period from angles-only data, which could significantly reduce sensor tasking requirements[^37].

The following table summarizes the key characteristics and performance of these advanced IOD techniques:

| Method | Core Principle | Key Advantage | Demonstrated Performance/Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PAR-PGMF with RF Fusion**[^35] | Probabilistic initialization + Gaussian Mixture filtering with multi-phenomenology data. | Enables tracking from single/short-arc detections; leverages complementary RF data. | Fused EO/TDOA/OWD data reduced position error to ~0.1% for a lunar resonant orbit. |
| **MCCLOD (Neural Network)**[^36] | Neural network mapping angles to CRTBP orbit family parameters. | Drastically improved initial guess accuracy; leverages known dynamics structure. | Position errors 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than Gooding's method for halo orbits. |
| **Universal Collocation IOD**[^37][^38] | Direct transcription of dynamics into sparse NLP constraints. | Large region of convergence; stable over multi-day/weeks observation gaps. | Position errors <50 km for various cislunar orbits (Halo, DRO, L4) with 10 arcsec noise. |

**Conclusion for Orbit Determination**
**The chaotic nature of cislunar dynamics necessitates a complete departure from Earth-orbit tracking paradigms, not just incremental improvements.** The combination of probabilistic initialization, machine learning-aided guessing, and robust collocation-based solvers forms a layered defense against data sparsity and dynamical complexity. These algorithms are the essential first step in transforming raw, infrequent sensor observations into the precise state estimates required for any subsequent characterization, threat assessment, or collision avoidance maneuver.

### 4.2 Robust Multi-Target Tracking and Maneuver Detection for Non-Cooperative Objects

Once initial custody is established, the paramount challenge is maintaining track of multiple objects through long periods without observations and through unpredictable maneuvers. The chaotic multi-body dynamics result in highly non-Gaussian state uncertainty distributions that grow rapidly during observation gaps[^39][^40]. Tracking a maneuvering object is even more difficult, as unknown maneuver times and magnitudes accelerate this uncertainty growth[^39]. Traditional filters designed for near-Earth, Keplerian regimes fail catasthetically under these conditions. This subchapter analyzes next-generation filtering techniques that directly address these cislunar-specific challenges.

**The Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Interacting Multiple Model (AGMIMM) Filter**
The AGMIMM filter represents a breakthrough in tracking non-cooperative, maneuvering objects in chaotic systems[^39][^40]. Its design is a direct response to the insufficiency of existing algorithms like the Square-Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SRUKF), the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM), and the Gaussian Mixture IMM (GMIMM)[^39]. **The AGMIMM's core innovation is a multi-pronged adaptation approach that simultaneously accounts for stochastic target modality changes (e.g., ballistic vs. maneuvering) and employs comprehensive multi-criterion mixture adaptation to handle nonlinear effects from dynamics, measurements, negative information (non-detections), and known constraints**[^39][^40].

A novel cluster-based merging algorithm is used to accurately approximate the entire target mode history, which significantly improves state estimation performance and robustness[^39]. In practical terms, the filter models object motion as a Jump Markov System (JMS), where the object's "mode" (e.g., ballistic or under thrust) switches according to a Markov chain[^39].

**Superior Performance in Challenging Scenarios**
The AGMIMM filter's effectiveness has been rigorously tested in high-fidelity simulations mimicking real mission profiles, such as an Artemis I-like trajectory featuring four impulsive maneuvers over 28.3 days, observed by a notional network of three space-based optical sensors[^39][^40]. The results are stark:

*   **During Long Observation Gaps:** While the error and uncertainty of the IMM and GMIMM filters grow to values on the order of 10^10 km, and the SRUKF uncertainty spans the entire Earth-Moon distance, **the AGMIMM maintains position errors an order of magnitude smaller, with uncertainty remaining localized near the Moon**[^39].
*   **Track Custody Retention:** In a 250-trial Monte Carlo analysis, **247 trials of the AGMIMM successfully retained track custody through the entire complex trajectory, including maneuvers executed during observation gaps**[^39]. In contrast, all trials of the SRUKF and IMM filters, and 248 trials of the GMIMM filter, failed shortly after the first major observation gap[^39][^40].
*   **State Estimation Accuracy:** For a sensor with a limiting magnitude of 14-16, the AGMIMM can achieve steady-state 3-sigma position uncertainties in the range of **400-500 meters to 2-3 km** for objects in L2 halo orbits, with velocity uncertainties below **1-2 cm/s**[^4].

**Computational Efficiency for Multi-Target Tracking**
As the population of cislunar objects grows, tracking dozens or hundreds of targets simultaneously becomes a massive computational challenge. The cost of a multi-target filter's prediction step is proportional to the cost of propagating a single object's uncertainty times the number of tracks[^41]. To address this, the **adaptive bi-fidelity orbit uncertainty propagation** method has been developed[^41].

This method intelligently balances accuracy and speed. It uses a predetermined map to select the optimal pair of low-fidelity (e.g., point-mass gravity) and high-fidelity (e.g., detailed non-spherical gravity field) dynamics models based on an object's estimated location[^41]. For instance, if an object is far from any major body, the cheap low-fidelity model suffices; if it approaches the Moon, the algorithm automatically switches to the more accurate, costly model[^41]. **This adaptive approach reduces the total multi-target filter runtime by 11-17% compared to a non-adaptive bi-fidelity method, without compromising tracking accuracy**[^41]. In one simulation with 20 objects, the adaptive method achieved an average OSPA tracking error of 15.69 km with a runtime of 30.94 seconds, compared to the original bi-fidelity method's 15.93 km error and 34.97-second runtime[^41].

**Conclusion for Tracking and Maneuver Detection**
**The AGMIMM filter, with its adaptive handling of modality and non-Gaussian uncertainty, is uniquely capable of maintaining custody of maneuvering non-cooperative targets in the cislunar regime, a task where all contemporary standard filters fail.** When combined with computational efficiency techniques like adaptive bi-fidelity propagation, it provides a scalable and robust backbone for a future multi-target CSSA system. This capability is not merely about maintaining a catalog; it is the foundation for detecting anomalous behavior, characterizing intent, and providing the accurate, timely state data needed for short-term decision support, such as evaluating potential threats or planning collision avoidance maneuvers.

### 4.3 Object Characterization, Change Detection, and Threat Assessment with Sparse Data

Beyond knowing *where* an object is, effective situational awareness requires understanding *what* it is and *what* it is doing. In the data-sparse cislunar environment, this characterization must be inferred from limited observational data, primarily astrometric (position) and photometric (brightness) measurements. This subchapter explores methodologies that transform these sparse data points into insights about an object's physical properties, operational status, and potential intent, directly feeding threat assessment workflows.

**Photometry-Based Change Detection and Object Identification**
Optical photometry—measuring an object's brightness over time—is a powerful tool for characterization. Two complementary methods have been developed for cislunar applications: the baseline method and the baseline-less method[^42].

*   **Baseline Method (for known/registered objects):** This method requires historical photometric and astrometric data. It constructs a "historical hypersurface"—a high-dimensional statistical model that learns the object's brightness characteristics as seen from any illumination and viewing geometry for a specific attitude profile[^42]. When new observations are received, the hypersurface is queried based on the object's orbital state to generate an expected light curve. A statistical comparison, such as a Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), is then used to flag deviations from this baseline[^42]. **This method is powerful because it can perform both Change Detection (CD) and Space Object Identification (SOI), distinguishing between different satellites or identifying when a known object has altered its attitude or configuration**[^42].

*   **Baseline-less Method (for unknown or unregistered objects):** When historical data is unavailable, this method utilizes three algorithms operating on a single collection of photometric data to detect changes in near real-time:
    1.  **Discontinuity Step:** Detects sudden jumps in brightness.
    2.  **Cumulative Sum (CuSum) control chart:** Detects shifts in the mean brightness level.
    3.  **Double Simple Linear Model Regression (DSLMR):** Detects changes in the brightness trend[^42].
    An "Interval of Interest" is defined where detections from these algorithms overlap, reducing false positives. **While this method cannot identify the specific object, it can reliably flag anomalous behavior, which is critical for cueing further investigation of potential threats**[^42].

Simulation testing on notional cislunar targets confirmed both methods effectively detect imposed attitude changes. The baseline method could even correctly identify the object in cross-tagging scenarios (where observations are incorrectly associated with the wrong catalog entry)[^42].

**Estimating Physical Parameters**
Characterization also involves estimating fundamental physical properties. An algorithm using a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach has been developed to estimate the **albedo-Area (aA) product** for cislunar Resident Space Objects[^42]. This product is a key parameter linking an object's size and reflectivity to its observed brightness. In one test, the algorithm estimated an aA value of 37 ± 24, compared to a truth model value of 36.4, demonstrating feasibility despite the inherent challenges of cislunar observation geometry[^42].

**Integrating Characterization into the Threat Assessment Workflow**
The outputs of orbit determination, maneuver detection, and photometric characterization must be fused to support intent analysis. The process can be conceptualized as a progressive refinement of the "common operational picture":

1.  **Detection & Initial OD:** A new object is detected, and its initial trajectory is estimated using collocation or PAR-PGMF methods.
2.  **Maneuver Detection & Refined Tracking:** As observations continue, an AGMIMM-class filter maintains custody and flags any deviations from a ballistic trajectory, characterizing the magnitude and direction of maneuvers.
3.  **Photometric Characterization:** Concurrent photometric measurements are analyzed. The baseline-less method provides an initial anomaly flag. If the object can be correlated with a catalog entry, the baseline method provides a deeper SOI and CD assessment, confirming identity or highlighting physical changes.
4.  **Intent Analysis & Threat Assessment:** The synthesized data—object origin, trajectory history, maneuver capability (ΔV), maneuver patterns, and physical characteristics—are evaluated against known patterns of life for friendly assets, typical mission profiles, and potential threat indicators. **For example, a small, non-cooperative object executing a series of maneuvers to closely approach a high-value asset like the Lunar Gateway would generate a high-priority threat warning, cueing immediate sensor tasking for close monitoring and potentially triggering defensive operational planning.**

**Conclusion for Characterization and Threat Assessment**
**In the cislunar domain, threat assessment cannot rely on dense, continuous data streams but must be built on the intelligent fusion of sparse, heterogeneous observations.** Advanced photometric techniques provide a vital layer of intelligence beyond mere kinematics, enabling discrimination between objects and detection of status changes. When integrated with robust tracking filters that can see through observational gaps and detect subtle maneuvers, these characterization methods form the core of a decision-support system capable of providing timely warnings and supporting effective short-term monitoring and response tasks in the vast and complex cislunar environment.

## 5 Optimizing for Short-Term Tasking: Command, Control, and Dynamic Response

This chapter analyzes the command and control (C2) paradigms and dynamic scheduling algorithms essential for a responsive Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (CSSA) system, directly addressing the need for effective short-term tracking and monitoring. Building upon the sensor architectures (Chapter 3) and data processing foundations (Chapter 4), it focuses on how to prioritize and task distributed sensor assets in near-real-time to respond to dynamic events such as new launches, detected maneuvers, anomalous behavior, or specific objects of interest. The analysis synthesizes insights from reference materials on adaptive sensor tasking frameworks, autonomous decision support, and network-centric communication architectures. It evaluates how these technologies enable the system to support contingency operations and time-critical monitoring missions by optimizing sensor resource allocation, managing uncertainty, and facilitating rapid, collaborative decision-making across a heterogeneous network.

### 5.1 Adaptive Sensor Tasking Frameworks for Dynamic Cislunar Environments

Effective short-term tracking in the vast and chaotic cislunar domain requires moving beyond static observation schedules to **dynamic, event-driven sensor tasking frameworks**. These frameworks must autonomously decide *which* sensor should look *where* and *when* to maintain custody of non-cooperative or maneuvering targets, optimizing the use of limited sensing resources. A leading architectural concept for this is the **Interoperable Cislunar Observation Network (ICON)**, designed to optimize sensor usage for detection, tracking, and tasking by leveraging existing platforms[^31].

The core of such an adaptive framework is a mathematical model that formalizes the decision-making process. A highly effective approach is to frame the multi-sensor scheduling problem as a **Semi-Markov Decision Process (sMDP)**[^31]. This model is defined by a tuple M = (A, S, T, R), where:
*   **Action Space (A):** The primary feasible actions are "Localized Search" and "Tracking". A search is initiated when a sensor is not actively tracking and the estimated target uncertainty exceeds the sensor's field of view. A tracking action involves executing recurring observations during a specific window of opportunity[^31].
*   **State Space (S):** This encompasses all possible states of the satellites in the network, including their position, velocity, attitude, tasking availability, and the current track catalog[^31].
*   **Reward Function R(s, a):** This is a custom, weighted function that evaluates the effectiveness of a state transition. Inputs include sensor position, imaging capabilities, physical occlusions (e.g., from Earth or Moon), and tasking freedom. The function aims to minimize tracking uncertainty and improve the quality of state estimates[^31].

The operational workflow begins when a sensor receives a **tracking tip message**, mathematically defined as M_track = (t_k, x_k, P_k), containing the time, estimated state vector, and covariance of a target[^31]. This tip prompts a localized search. The estimated target state and uncertainty are propagated to the expected search window and projected into the sensor's measurement space (azimuth-elevation). The resulting search volume is discretized into a grid, and the sensor performs a raster scan based on its parameters[^31]. **Crucially, the framework enables collaborative tracking:** once an object is identified by a primary sensor, the availability and applicability of other sensors in the region are calculated to determine which assets could gain or maintain custody. These additional sensors are then autonomously tasked based on the reward function, facilitating the transfer of custody across the network and a collective reduction in position and velocity uncertainty over time[^31].

The framework incorporates **event-driven policy adjustment mechanisms** for real-time responsiveness. These include a maximum search time threshold to prevent resource waste, and automatic policy updates when a satellite receives a new tracking tip, forcing a recalculation of the search volume and tasks[^31]. In a simulated 48-hour scenario tracking a non-cooperative target transiting from LEO to the Moon, a network of six space-based sensors using this adaptive tasking scheduled **145 observations**. Collaboration was key: a sensor in a distant retrograde orbit made 115 observations, while others in a 3:1 resonant orbit and an L1 Halo orbit contributed 20 and 10 observations, respectively. This collaborative, adaptive scheduling **significantly enhanced overall tracking accuracy** compared to non-coordinated approaches[^31].

For the higher-level problem of designing the sensor constellation itself, optimization algorithms are critical. A comparison of greedy and genetic algorithms for capacity-based architecture optimization reveals important trade-offs. A standard greedy algorithm, while computationally efficient, only guarantees local optimal performance. In one study, a greedy-optimized architecture of seven satellites achieved a maximum cumulative coverage capacity of 90.5%[^15]. In contrast, a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, a heuristic evolutionary method, consistently outperformed the greedy approach, achieving **94% capacity** for the same architecture[^15]. **The GA's strength lies in its ability to explore solutions with lower immediate reward that may lead to better overall coverage over the entire mission span**, making it particularly valuable for dynamic environments where long-term planning is essential[^15]. This capability to test non-obvious solutions is a critical enabler for a system that must respond dynamically to emerging threats and tracking priorities.

### 5.2 Autonomous Decision Support and Onboard Maneuver Planning

Short-term response in cislunar space is critically hampered by long communication delays with Earth, which can span several seconds to minutes. Therefore, effective support for time-critical monitoring and contingency operations necessitates a high degree of **onboard autonomy and artificial intelligence (AI)**. This allows spacecraft and sensor networks to make decisions and execute actions without waiting for ground intervention, closing the decision loop within tactically relevant timelines.

A foundational requirement for autonomous operations is the ability for a spacecraft to navigate and replan its trajectory independently. Research has demonstrated the use of **supervised learning neural networks (NNs)** to automate maneuver design in highly sensitive cislunar regions[^43]. The technique involves training NNs on optimal maneuver parameters for a predefined mission concept. When the spacecraft experiences perturbations (e.g., launch insertion errors), the NNs can **sample the perturbed state and autonomously prescribe the necessary coast time and optimal maneuver commands** to compensate, serving a similar purpose to an onboard numerical targeter but without the risk of iteration divergence[^43]. This method has been tested for orbit raising, translunar injection burns, powered lunar flybys, and invariant manifold insertions, enabling complex mission execution autonomously[^43].

This research is being transitioned into practical demonstrations. NASA’s CAPSTONE cubesat, operating in a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), is testing an integrated software suite dubbed **"Autopilot"**[^44]. This suite combines several AI-driven capabilities:
*   **Neural Networks for Enhanced Planning:** Calculates optimal maneuvers for autonomous station-keeping and validates safe maneuvers.
*   **SigmaZero software:** Identifies and classifies anomalies in spacecraft behavior.
*   **Flight Dynamics System:** Appraises rapid-turnaround navigation and maneuver planning[^44].

The collective goal of these components is to achieve a spacecraft that **autonomously knows where it is, what time it is, how to maneuver correctly, and how to validate those maneuvers with integrity**[^44]. This level of onboard intelligence is directly applicable to sensor platforms within a CSSA network, allowing them to dynamically adjust their observation schedules or orbital parameters in response to detected events without ground commanding.

The imperative for such autonomy is underscored in broader technical visions. The *Cislunar Security National Technical Vision* identifies **mission autonomy as critical**, requiring spacecraft to perform tasks and collaborate without human intervention, especially during communication-denied periods[^18]. It explicitly calls for the development of **autonomous mission design algorithms**, such as those using ant colony optimization or reinforcement learning, to optimize constellation performance and respond to dynamic conditions[^18]. Furthermore, the document highlights a major technological gap: the lack of **radiation-hardened, space-qualified computing resources** capable of running these complex algorithms in the cislunar environment[^18]. Bridging this gap is essential to deploying the advanced onboard processing required for true short-term dynamic response.

### 5.3 Network-Centric Command & Control and Delay-Tolerant Data Synchronization

The adaptive tasking and autonomous capabilities described previously cannot function in isolation; they require a robust, resilient communication backbone. The traditional, application-centric model of point-to-point links is inadequate for the scalable, collaborative networks needed for cislunar situational awareness. Instead, a **network-centric architecture** is advocated, which centralizes data communication functions to reduce application complexity, improve resource utilization, and enable standardized, interoperable behavior[^18].

A prime example of this paradigm is NASA’s **LunaNet** concept, an envisioned interconnected network of nodes providing communication, navigation, and science services[^18]. To operate in the cislunar environment—characterized by vast distances, predictable but time-varying topology, and frequent signal interruptions—such networks rely on **Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN)** protocols[^18]. The key enabling technology is the **Bundle Protocol (BPv7)** along with its security extension **BPSec**. This protocol implements a secure **store-and-forward** transport mechanism, allowing data bundles to be relayed hop-by-hop across intermittently connected nodes, supporting end-to-end security and enabling different security policies for different data blocks within a bundle[^18].

Within this constrained network, prioritizing data flow to maintain a current operational picture for decision-makers is paramount. This challenge is exemplified in the context of **Delay-Tolerant Digital Twins (DTs)**, where a physical asset (e.g., a lunar robot) must synchronize its state with a virtual model on Earth. A novel scheduling algorithm combining the **Age of Synchronization (AoS)** metric with a **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** decision framework has been proposed to optimize this process[^45]. The algorithm assigns a weight to each piece of state data (e.g., photo, video, LIDAR scan) based on its AoS (how outdated it is), its priority, and how often it has been sent previously. The scheduler then selects items to transmit within the available bandwidth to minimize the sum of these weights[^45].

**This intelligent prioritization ensures that the most critical and fresh information is transmitted first, allowing ground-based or centralized command nodes to maintain a sufficiently accurate common operational picture.** In simulations, this MAB (AoS) algorithm maintained a stable and low average Age of Information (AoI) and transmitted more updates overall compared to simpler schedulers, providing a better overall representation of the remote asset[^45]. For a CSSA system, such algorithms are vital to ensure that sensor tasking commands are based on timely data, and that the results of those tasks (e.g., new detections, updated tracks) are efficiently relayed back to fusion centers and users, closing the loop for dynamic response.

In summary, optimizing for short-term tasking in cislunar space demands a tightly integrated triad of capabilities: **adaptive, algorithm-driven sensor scheduling** to optimally allocate resources; **advanced onboard autonomy** to execute responses within communication latency windows; and a **network-centric, delay-tolerant communication architecture** to bind the system together and ensure decision-critical data flows. Together, these elements transform a collection of sensors into a responsive, intelligent network capable of supporting time-critical monitoring and contingency operations in the most challenging space domain.

## 6 A Proposed Framework for Incremental Development and Validation

This chapter synthesizes the findings from the preceding analysis to propose a structured, incremental framework for building and validating a comprehensive Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (CSSA) capability. The framework is designed to directly address the core challenge of achieving comprehensive and accurate awareness to support short-term tracking and monitoring tasks. It outlines a phased development roadmap that transitions from leveraging and augmenting existing assets to deploying dedicated, advanced systems. Crucially, the framework is grounded in the specific enabling technologies, architectural optimization strategies, and validation methodologies detailed in the reference materials, ensuring a feasible path from concept to operational capability.

### 6.1 A Phased Development Roadmap: From Current Capabilities to Future Architectures

A successful CSSA capability cannot be deployed overnight. It requires a pragmatic, phased approach that builds upon existing infrastructure, demonstrates new technologies in relevant environments, and scales to a fully operational system. This roadmap aligns with strategic actions from the National Cislunar S&T Action Plan and directly addresses the critical technology gaps identified in the *Cislunar Security National Technical Vision*[^18].

**Phase 0: Augmentation and Integration of Existing Assets (Near-Term, 0-5 Years)**
This initial phase focuses on maximizing the utility of current systems while laying the foundational groundwork for future expansion.
*   **Goal:** Establish initial cislunar tracking capability, improve data fusion, and develop operational procedures.
*   **Key Actions & Technologies:**
    *   **Algorithmic Enhancement of Ground Sensors:** Deploy advanced post-processing algorithms, such as motion hypothesis detection and machine learning techniques for low signal-to-noise ratio detections, to extend the detection range and custody maintenance capability of existing ground-based optical networks for known cislunar objects[^18].
    *   **Standardization and Data Sharing:** Implement standardized ephemeris data formats like SPICE or CCSDS Orbit Data Messages (ODM/OCM) to replace the inadequate Two-Line Element (TLE) format for cislunar object tracking[^18]. Establish secure data-sharing procedures between U.S. government agencies (DoD, NASA), commercial operators, and international partners to develop an integrated initial catalog.
    *   **Modeling & Simulation Foundation:** Utilize and contribute to digital engineering environments like the **Aerospace Cislunar Modeling Environment (ACME)** to simulate cislunar dynamics, sensor performance, and traffic scenarios, informing architecture design and validation[^46].
*   **Architectural Characteristic:** A **federated network** reliant on upgraded ground assets and nascent data fusion centers. Coverage remains limited, particularly within the lunar exclusion zone and for small objects.

**Phase 1: Initial Space-Based Demonstrators and Adaptive Tasking Validation (Mid-Term, 5-10 Years)**
This phase introduces dedicated cislunar sensor platforms to validate key technologies and operational concepts in the actual domain.
*   **Goal:** Demonstrate persistent coverage of high-value regions, validate autonomous sensor tasking, and mature critical technologies.
*   **Key Actions & Technologies:**
    *   **Dedicated Demonstration Missions:** Deploy initial sensor payloads on platforms like the **Cislunar Highway Patrol System (CHPS)** and the **Defense Deep Space Sentinel (D2S2)** into strategically chosen cislunar orbits such as Earth-Moon L1/L2 halo orbits or Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs)[^47]. These payloads should combine sensor types (e.g., narrow/wide-angle imagers, passive RF detectors) to evaluate performance[^47].
    *   **Validation of Adaptive Frameworks:** Operate these demonstrators within an **Interoperable Cislunar Observation Network (ICON)**-like architecture to test and refine **semi-Markov Decision Process (sMDP)**-based collaborative sensor tasking strategies for maintaining custody of non-cooperative targets[^31].
    *   **Autonomy and On-Board Processing:** Test **autonomous mission design algorithms** (e.g., reinforcement learning) and neural-network-based maneuver planning on demonstrator platforms, building on lessons from missions like CAPSTONE[^18].
*   **Architectural Characteristic:** A **hybrid pilot network** combining enhanced ground assets with a small number of space-based demonstrators. Coverage becomes persistent in selected Lagrange regions and transit corridors, validating the core concepts for scalable deployment.

**Phase 2: Operational Hybrid Constellation Scaling (Long-Term, 10+ Years)**
This final phase scales the validated concepts into a robust, multi-layered operational system.
*   **Goal:** Achieve comprehensive, accurate, and responsive CSSA across defined high-priority volumes.
*   **Key Actions & Technologies:**
    *   **Constellation Deployment and Optimization:** Use advanced heuristic optimization algorithms, such as the **enhanced "Categorical" Genetic Algorithm (GA)** or solutions to the **Time-Expanded p-Median Problem (TE-p-MP)**, to design and deploy an operational constellation of 5-9 or more space-based sensors with optimized phasing and orbital diversity (e.g., mix of halo, Lyapunov, DRO)[^48][^29].
    *   **Integration of Lunar Surface Assets:** Incorporate **in-situ sensors** like surface-based imagers (e.g., Clavius-S concept) into the network to provide high-cadence monitoring of Low Lunar Orbit (LLO) and enhance lunar domain awareness[^49].
    *   **Closing Critical Technology Gaps:** Field **radiation-hardened, space-qualified computational hardware** capable of running advanced autonomy and fusion algorithms locally in the cislunar environment[^18]. Fully implement **delay-tolerant networking (DTN)** with the Bundle Protocol (BPv7/BPSec) for resilient, network-centric command, control, and communications[^46].
*   **Architectural Characteristic:** A **scalable, hybrid, and layered operational architecture** integrating ground, cislunar orbital, and lunar surface sensors into a cohesive, autonomously tasking network capable of supporting stringent short-term tracking requirements.

### 6.2 Validation through Integrated Modeling, Simulation, and Digital Engineering

Validation of CSSA system designs and performance predictions is paramount before committing to expensive hardware development and deployment. An integrated digital engineering approach, leveraging high-fidelity modeling and simulation, provides the necessary testbed.

**Core Digital Engineering Infrastructure**
The **Aerospace Cislunar Modeling Environment (ACME)** serves as a prototype for the type of integrated digital toolbox required[^46]. Such environments enable stakeholders to collaboratively model, simulate, and test entire space system lifecycles. The envisioned collaborative ecosystem, notionally called the **LUNAverse**, aims to become a publicly available digital engineering environment where system interactions can be explored, existing digital twins can be linked, and new mission concepts can be tried[^46]. **These platforms are essential for simulating the unique physics of cislunar space and modeling interactions between communications, SSA sensors, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) infrastructure**[^46].

**Architecture Optimization and Trade-Space Analysis**
Validation must employ the advanced optimization frameworks analyzed in previous chapters to rigorously explore design trade-offs:
*   **Rapid Architecture Exploration:** The **Time-Expanded p-Median Problem (TE-p-MP)** formulation, solved using efficient methods like the custom **Lagrangian Method (LM)**, allows for the rapid generation and comparison of near-optimal constellation designs for specific coverage demands (e.g., static "Cone of Shame" or dynamic low-energy transfer windows)[^29]. This enables quantitative benchmarking against coverage percentage requirements.
*   **Phasing and Tasking Co-Optimization:** The **concurrent optimization** framework, with its outer loop (phasing) and inner loop (tasking via Integer Linear Programming), is critical for validating that a proposed constellation can maximize information gain—a direct proxy for tracking accuracy—under dynamic conditions[^34]. Comparing "max" (total gain) and "maxmin" (equitable coverage) objectives ensures the architecture supports diverse monitoring tasks[^34].
*   **Heuristic Performance Validation:** Tools like the **enhanced Categorical GA** must be used to validate that proposed sensor placements in families like L1 Southern Halo orbits achieve superior observation accessibility (Γ_Mv) and stability trade-offs compared to less flexible design methods[^48].

**Performance Metrics and Stress Testing**
Simulations within these digital environments must utilize defined metrics to validate against Chapter 2 requirements:
*   **Coverage Comprehensiveness:** Metrics like **observation accessibility (Γ_Mv)** and mean observable time fraction for target grids must be calculated to verify spatial coverage claims[^48].
*   **Tracking Accuracy:** Simulations must incorporate measurement models and filters (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter) to demonstrate achievable position and velocity uncertainties (e.g., 1-2 km, <1 cm/s) for representative orbits[^31].
*   **Dynamic Response:** Scenarios involving non-cooperative, maneuvering targets must be simulated to test the **adaptive sensor tasking frameworks** and **maneuver detection capabilities** (e.g., using AGMIMM-class filters), measuring metrics like custody retention rate and time to re-acquire track after a maneuver[^31].

### 6.3 Demonstration Missions and Advanced Analytical Validation Techniques

While simulation is indispensable, in-space demonstration and advanced analytical techniques are required to de-risk technologies and validate performance in the real, chaotic cislunar environment.

**Targeted Demonstration Missions**
Specific mission concepts from the reference materials provide clear pathways for incremental validation:
*   **Cislunar Highway Patrol System (CHPS):** Orchestrated by the Air Force Research Lab, CHPS is a prime candidate for an early demonstrator[^47]. Deploying a sensor payload into a **halo orbit around Earth-Moon L1 or L2** would validate sensor performance at cislunar ranges, test orbit maintenance in unstable regimes, and begin generating real tracking data on cooperative and non-cooperative objects in these critical regions[^47].
*   **Defense Deep Space Sentinel (D2S2):** This program represents another necessary step toward operational capability, likely focusing on different sensor modalities or orbital regimes to broaden the validated technology base[^47].
*   **Lunar Surface Sensor Integration:** Deploying a sensor like **Clavius-S** on a commercial lunar lander would validate the concept of surface-based LLO monitoring, providing real-world data on viewing geometry advantages and integration into a broader network[^49].

**Advanced Analytical Techniques for Bounding Performance**
For the most challenging SSA scenarios, particularly involving low-thrust, non-cooperative spacecraft, novel analytical methods are essential for validation and risk assessment.
*   **Reachability Analysis for Low-Thrust Spacecraft:** The novel technique leveraging **State-Transition Tensors (STTs)** and **polynomial zonotopes** provides a powerful validation tool[^50]. Unlike methods requiring thousands of trajectory propagations, this approach **directly computes the reachable set—the continuum of possible future states—of a maneuvering spacecraft with a single numerical integration**[^50]. This is critical for:
    *   **Evaluating Collision Probability:** The reachable set, converted to a polytope, can be used for rigorous conjunction analysis.
    *   **Defining Detection Regions:** The set visually and analytically defines where sensors must search to re-acquire a lost or maneuvering object.
    *   **Testing Tracking Filters:** The true reachable set serves as a benchmark to evaluate the performance and uncertainty bounds estimated by filters like the AGMIMM.
*   **Game-Theoretical Exploration for Competitive Scenarios:** Applying **Bayesian game theory** to model interactions between competing teams deploying heterogeneous observer spacecraft (e.g., "searchers," "observers") provides a structured framework to validate constellation robustness and tasking strategies in adversarial conditions[^51]. Analyzing **Bayes-Nash equilibria** and **Pareto fronts** helps identify optimal sensor mixes and strategies that balance identification gains, cost, and detection risk, ensuring the architecture remains effective under competition[^51].

**Addressing the Foundational Computing Gap**
A consistent theme across validation phases is the need for **capable cislunar computing resources**[^18]. Demonstration missions must progressively test and mature **radiation-hardened computational hardware** capable of hosting the advanced autonomy, sensor fusion, and reachability calculation algorithms on-board. Success in this area is a prerequisite for transitioning from ground-centric processing to the distributed, responsive network required for effective short-term tasking.

**Conclusion of the Framework**
The proposed framework—integrating a phased roadmap, rigorous digital engineering validation, targeted demonstration missions, and advanced analytical techniques—provides a concrete, evidence-based path forward. It ensures that each step toward a comprehensive CSSA capability is validated against the stringent requirements for accuracy and short-term responsiveness, ultimately delivering a system capable of safeguarding the burgeoning cislunar ecosystem.
